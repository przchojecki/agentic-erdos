The powers of $2$ show that $2^n$ would be best possible here. The trivial lower bound is $N \\gg 2^{n}/n$, since all $2^n$ distinct subset sums must lie in $[0,Nn)$. Erdos and Moser \\cite{Er56} proved $ N\\geq (\\tfrac{1}{4}-o(1))\\frac{2^n}{\\sqrt{n}}. $ (In \\cite{Er85c} Erdos offered \\$100 for any improvement of the constant $1/4$ here.) A number of improvements of the constant have been given (see \\cite{St23} for a history), with the current record $\\sqrt{2/\\pi}$ first proved in unpublished work of Elkies and Gleason. Two proofs achieving this constant are provided by Dubroff, Fox, and Xu \\cite{DFX21}, who in fact prove the exact bound $N\\geq \\binom{n}{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}$. In \\cite{Er73} and \\cite{ErGr80} the generalisation where $A\\subseteq (0,N]$ is a set of real numbers such that the subset sums all differ by at least $1$ is proposed, with the same conjectured bound. (The second proof of \\cite{DFX21} applies also to this generalisation.) This generalisation seems to have first appeared in \\cite{Gr71}. This problem appears in Erdos' book with Spencer \\cite{ErSp74} in the final chapter titled 'The kitchen sink'. As Ruzsa writes in \\cite{Ru99} \"it is a rich kitchen where such things go to the sink\". The sequence of minimal $N$ for a given $n$ is A276661 in the OEIS. See also [350].

For example, a bound like $ r_k(N) \\ll_k \\frac{N}{(\\log N)(\\log\\log N)^2} $ would be sufficient. Even the case $k=3$ is non-trivial, but was proved by Bloom and Sisask \\cite{BlSi20}. Much better bounds for $r_3(N)$ were subsequently proved by Kelley and Meka \\cite{KeMe23}. Green and Tao \\cite{GrTa17} proved $r_4(N)\\ll N/(\\log N)^{c}$ for some small constant $c>0$. Gowers \\cite{Go01} proved $ r_k(N) \\ll \\frac{N}{(\\log\\log N)^{c_k}}, $ where $c_k>0$ is a small constant depending on $k$.

Tao \\cite{Ta23} has proved that this series does converge assuming a strong form of the Hardy-Littlewood prime tuples conjecture.

Weisenberg notes that the existence of infinitely many bounded gaps between primes (as proved by Zhang \\cite{Zh14}) implies the latter series does not converge. Weisenberg also has an argument which shows that, assuming the Hardy-Littlewood prime $k$-tuples conjecture, the series is unbounded in at least one direction (positive or negative). Erdos further conjectured that $ \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^n \\frac{1}{n(p_{n+1}-p_n)(\\log\\log n)^c} $ converges for every $c>0$, and reports that he and Nathanson can prove that this series converges absolutely for $c>2$ (and can show, conditional on 'hopeless' conjectures about the primes, that this sum does not converge absolutely for $c=2$). Sawhney has provided the following proof that this series converges absolutely for $c>2$: note that, whenever $c>1$, the contribution to the sum from gaps $p_{n+1}-p_n\\geq \\log n$ is convergent, so it suffices to consider only small gaps.

A complete history of sum-product bounds can be found at this webpage. There is likely nothing special about the integers in this question, and indeed Erdos and Szemer\\'{e}di also ask a similar question about finite sets of real or complex numbers.

One can in general ask this question in any setting where addition and multiplication are defined (once one avoids any trivial obstructions such as zero divisors or finite subfields). For example, it makes sense for subsets of finite fields.

The earliest such quote in a paper of Erdos I have found is in \\cite{Er93}, where he writes: 'Sometime ago, I made the following joke. If an evil spirit would appear and say \"unless you give me the value of $R(5)$ within a year, I will exterminate humanity\", then our best bet would be perhaps to get all our computers working on $R(5)$ and we probably would get its value in a year. If he would ask for $R(6)$, the best strategy probably would be to destroy it before it can destroy us. If we would be so clever that we could give the answer by mathematics, we would just tell him: \"if you try to do something you will see what will happent to you...\". I think we are strong enugh now and the only evil spirit we have to feel is the one which is in ourselves (quoting somebody: I have seen the enemy and them are us).

This is equivalent to asking whether the chromatic number of the square of the line graph $L(G)^2$ is at most $\\frac{5}{4}\\Delta^2$. This bound would be the best possible, as witnessed by a blowup of $C_5$. The minimum number of such sets required is sometimes called the strong chromatic index of $G$. The weaker conjecture that there exists some $c>0$ such that $(2-c)\\Delta^2$ sets suffice was proved by Molloy and Reed \\cite{MoRe97}, who proved that $1.998\\Delta^2$ sets suffice (for $\\Delta$ sufficiently large). This was improved to $1.93\\Delta^2$ by Bruhn and Joos \\cite{BrJo18} and to $1.835\\Delta^2$ by Bonamy, Perrett, and Postle \\cite{BPP22}. The best bound currently available is $ 1.772\\Delta^2, $ proved by Hurley, de Joannis de Verclos, and Kang \\cite{HJK22}. Mahdian has, in their Masters' thesis, proved an upper bound of $(2+o(1))\\frac{\\Delta^2}{\\log \\Delta}$ under the additional assumption that $G$ is $C_4$-free.

In \\cite{Er88c} Erdos goes further and speculates that $\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{2^n-t_n}$ is irrational for every infinite set $A$ and bounded sequence $t_n$ (presumably of integers, and presumably excluding the case when $t_n=0$ for all $n$). This was disproved by Kova\\v{c} and Tao \\cite{KoTa24}, and in the comments Kova\\v{c} has sketched a proof that there exists some choice of $t_n$ with $1\\leq t_n\\leq 6$ such that this sum is rational.

It is easy to see that all square numbers have this property (in fact for square numbers any triangle will do). Soifer \\cite{So09c} has shown that numbers of the form $2n^2,3n^2,6n^2,n^2+m^2$ also have this property. Beeson has shown (see the slides below) that $7$ and $11$ do not have this property. It is possible that any prime of the form $4n+3$ does not have this property. In particular, it is not known if $19$ has this property (i.e. are there $19$ congruent triangles which can be assembled into a triangle?). For more on this problem see these slides from a talk by Michael Beeson. As a demonstration of this problem we include {IMAGE=634Triangle,a picture} of a cutting of an equilateral triangle into $27$ congruent triangles from these slides. Soifer proved \\cite{So09} that if we relax congruence to similarity then every triangle can be cut into $N$ similar triangles when $N eq 2,3,5$. If one requires the smaller triangles to be similar to the larger triangle then the only possible values of $N$ are $n^2,n^2+m^2,3n^2$, proved by Snover, Waiveris, and Williams \\cite{SWW91}. Zhang \\cite{Zh25}, among other results, has proved that for any integers $a \\geq b$, if $ n\\geq 3\\left\\lceil \\frac{a^2+b^2+ab-a-b}{ab}\\right\\rceil $ then $n^2ab$ has this property (indeed, they explicitly show that an equilateral triangle can be tiled with $n^2ab$ many triangles of side lengths $a,b,\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+2+ab}$).

In general, it is known that $ (d-o(1))n \\leq f_d(n) \\leq 2^{O(d)}n, $ the lower bound coming from points arranged in an integer grid and the upper bound from the fact that $2^{O(d)}$ many non-intersecting congruent balls can touch a fixed ball (the kissing number problem).

Otherwise if $n$ is odd then let $3^k$ be the largest power of $3$ which is $\\leq n$ and apply the inductive hypothesis to $n-3^k$ (which is even). Yu and Chen \\cite{YuCh22} prove that the set of non-representable numbers has density zero whenever $q>3$ or $q=3$ and $p>6$ or $q=2$ and $p>10$. They also prove that there are infinitely many coprime non-representable numbers if $q>3$ or $q=3$ and $p eq 5$ or $q=2$ and $p ot\\in \\{3,5,9\\}$. Erdos and Lewin \\cite{ErLe96} also asked whether all large integers $n$ can be written as a sum of $2^k3^l$, none of which divide another, each of which is $>f(n)$ for some $f(n)\\to \\infty$. Let $f(n)$ be the fastest growing such $f(n)$. Yu and Chen \\cite{YuCh22} proved $ \\frac{n}{(\\log n)^{\\log_23}}\\ll f(n) \\ll \\frac{n}{\\log n}. $ Yang and Zhao \\cite{YaZh25} improved the lower bound to $f(n)\\gg n/\\log n$. The case of three powers is the subject of [123], and see also [845] for more on the case $\\{p,q\\}=\\{2,3\\}$. The problem [246] addresses the topic without the non-divisibility condition.

This establishes that there is a positive density set of such $m$. The smallest Sierpinski number is believed to be $78557$, which was found by Selfridge. Erdos and Graham \\cite{ErGr80} asked whether there are Sierpinski numbers for which a covering system is not 'responsible', for which the best interpretation seems to be the above question. This is formulated precisely in problem F13 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}. Erdos and Graham thought the answer is yes (in that there are such Sierpinski numbers), since otherwise this would imply there are infinitely many Fermat primes. There is now further evidence with a concrete example: an argument of Izotov \\cite{Iz95}, given in more detail by Filaseta, Finch, and Kozek \\cite{FFK08}, suggests that $m=734110615000775^4$ is a Sierpinski number without a covering set.
