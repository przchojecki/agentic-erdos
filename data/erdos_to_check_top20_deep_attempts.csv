"1","EP-25","Erdős Problem #25","not_proved","Modeled A as an uncovered set for an infinite system of forbidden residue classes; attempted logarithmic-density convergence via truncated systems and inclusion-exclusion stability.","No useful independence/coprimality structure on the moduli sequence, so truncation error can oscillate and block convergence of logarithmic density.","Seek structural conditions on (n_i) that force convergence, then test whether arbitrary systems can be reduced to those conditions."
"2","EP-40","Erdős Problem #40","not_proved","Attempted second-moment/additive-energy route: assume |A∩[1,N]| is just above N^{1/2}/g(N), then force unbounded representation counts in 1_A*1_A.","The density is near the critical square-root barrier, and current tools do not force limsup representation multiplicity to diverge uniformly at that scale.","Prove a robust transfer theorem from near-critical density to large local additive energy spikes."
"3","EP-42","Erdős Problem #42","not_proved","Tried a random-greedy construction of B avoiding nonzero differences from A-A while preserving Sidon constraints in B.","Need simultaneous control of two sparse-structure constraints (Sidon for B and disjoint difference sets), and available counting is too weak in the dense forbidden-difference regime.","Build a container/nibble argument with explicit forbidden-difference degree bounds depending on M and N."
"4","EP-43","Erdős Problem #43","partially_resolved_not_fully_closed","Used difference-set counting under Sidon assumptions to recover the natural 1/sqrt(2) scale when |A|=|B|.","Background already gives a negative answer to the stronger second question (no fixed c>0 improvement), so only the first O(1)-precision extremal inequality remains open.","Focus on whether the first inequality can be sharpened with exact finite-size correction terms."
"5","EP-70","Erdős Problem #70","not_proved","Tried to lift known continuum partition relations from (omega+n,4)_2^3 toward (beta,n)_2^3 for arbitrary countable beta via transfinite recursion.","The available partition-calculus step-up does not directly propagate to all countable ordinals and all finite n with the same ambient cardinal.","Test special subclasses of countable beta (e.g., additive indecomposables) for a workable induction schema first."
"6","EP-103","Erdős Problem #103","not_proved","Attempted rigidity approach for minimum-diameter point sets with pairwise distance >=1, seeking multiple noncongruent minimizers for large n.","Even proving h(n)>=2 eventually is open per background; no general mechanism forces non-uniqueness of minimizers.","Search explicit infinite families of near-lattice extremizers where two inequivalent perturbations stay diameter-optimal."
"7","EP-129","Erdős Problem #129","statement_issue_likely_false_as_written","Checked consistency against the random-coloring heuristic used in the background discussion for r=2.","Background indicates a probabilistic lower bound R(n;3,2) >= C^n, contradicting the conjectured upper bound C^{sqrt(n)}.","Clarify the intended corrected statement before further proof attempts."
"8","EP-152","Erdős Problem #152","not_proved","Tried to count isolated sums in A+A (where neighbors a±1 are missing) via local gap statistics induced by Sidon structure.","Sidon uniqueness controls collisions of sums but gives limited control on nearest-neighbor occupancy around each sum.","Derive a local sparsity lemma for A+A intervals of fixed width to force many isolated points."
"9","EP-153","Erdős Problem #153","not_proved","Attempted second-moment-of-gaps strategy on ordered A+A, linking large mean squared gaps to low local clustering.","Current Sidon bounds do not directly imply divergence of the average squared successive gap.","Combine additive-combinatorial spacing bounds with a variance lower bound for ordered sumsets."
"10","EP-155","Erdős Problem #155","not_proved","Studied local increments of F(N), aiming to show eventual one-step growth under fixed k-shifts.","Known asymptotics for maximal Sidon size are too coarse to control short-interval fluctuations F(N+k)-F(N).","Develop short-interval stability estimates for extremal Sidon constructions."
"11","EP-158","Erdős Problem #158","not_proved","Tried to adapt Sidon liminf arguments to the weaker ""at most 2 representations"" condition via representation counting.","Allowing two representations greatly increases flexible structure, and the Sidon rigidity tools no longer force liminf density collapse.","Find a decomposition into near-Sidon components or prove a replacement rigidity inequality for r_2(n)<=2."
"12","EP-162","Erdős Problem #162","not_proved","Reproduced the logarithmic-scale window via probabilistic method heuristics and searched for constant-level sharpening.","Determining c_alpha needs sharp dependence control across many induced subgraphs, beyond coarse union-bound methods.","Use large-deviation machinery tailored to induced density constraints to pin down c_alpha."
"13","EP-180","Erdős Problem #180","statement_issue_counterexample_in_background","Cross-checked the claim against the finite-family star+matching example described in the background.","That example gives ex(n;F)=O(1) while each single-graph extremal function is Theta(n), contradicting the statement as written.","Formulate a restricted version (excluding known counterexample patterns) before attempting proof."
"14","EP-190","Erdős Problem #190","not_proved","Attempted canonical-Ramsey lower/upper growth comparison using Szemeredi-driven existence plus anti-rainbow constructions.","Current quantitative Szemeredi/canonical tools do not determine the conjectured superlinear-in-k exponential scale for H(k)^{1/k}.","Improve either lower-bound constructions avoiding both monochromatic and rainbow k-APs, or upper bounds via density-increment refinements."
"15","EP-197","Erdős Problem #197","not_proved","Tried recursive block permutations in two-color partition classes to suppress monotone 3-term APs after permutation.","Cross-block interactions reintroduce monotone AP patterns even when each block is locally controlled.","Design a hierarchical interleaving rule with provable cross-scale AP avoidance invariants."
"16","EP-200","Erdős Problem #200","not_proved","Used random-primes heuristic and existing AP-in-primes framework to test plausibility of sub-logarithmic maximal progression length.","Need strong upper bounds for long prime APs in [1,N], and current transference tools are better at existence than tight maximal-length control.","Pursue upper-tail bounds for counts of long prime APs under pseudorandom majorants."
"17","EP-203","Erdős Problem #203","not_proved","Attempted a covering-congruence construction assigning prime divisors to all values 2^k 3^l m + 1 across exponent classes.","Need a finite congruence covering of the 2D exponent lattice compatible with one fixed m and all k,l >= 0.","Search for periodic exponent-class coverings modulo lcm of multiplicative orders with CRT consistency constraints on m."
"18","EP-234","Erdős Problem #234","not_proved_statement_text_noisy","Interpreted the problem as existence/continuity of distribution for normalized prime gaps (p_{n+1}-p_n)/log n below threshold c.","A full limiting distribution for normalized consecutive prime gaps is not currently established in this strong form.","First clean the statement text, then split into: (i) existence of density f(c), (ii) continuity of f."
"19","EP-249","Erdős Problem #249","not_proved","Rewrote sum phi(n)/2^n via divisor-sum identities to express it as a rapidly convergent arithmetic series amenable to irrationality criteria.","No direct irrationality criterion applies cleanly to this specific weighted totient series at x=1/2.","Build rational approximation bounds from truncated divisor expansions and seek contradiction with too-good approximants."
"20","EP-273","Erdős Problem #273","not_proved","Tried covering-system construction with allowed moduli p-1 (p>=5), balancing congruence classes to achieve full integer coverage.","Covering conditions interact strongly through lcm structure, and restricting moduli to p-1 leaves sparse arithmetic flexibility.","Run bounded-depth computational search over admissible moduli sets and residue assignments to identify candidate templates."
