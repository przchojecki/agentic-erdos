It follows that such an $m$ is equal to some $a_i$ in the sequence defined for $[1,n)$, and $m$ is composite by assumption.","status":"open","category_id":1,"difficulty_level_id":1,"reference_years":[],"latest_reference_year":null,"references_section_present":false,"classification":"to-check","to_check_rank":48,"ease_bucket":"no-reference-years","proof_attempt_status":"not_proved_no_reference_block","proof_attempt_domain":"number_theory","proof_attempt_strategy":"Tried minimal-counterexample plus modular/sieve-style reductions.","proof_attempt_hard_part":"Hard point: obtaining enough uniformity/cancellation beyond what current modular or sieve control gives.","proof_attempt_concise":"Tried minimal-counterexample plus modular/sieve-style reductions.

Erdos and Hajnal showed this does not generalise to higher cardinals - they (see \\cite{Er69b}) constructed a set on $\\omega_1^2$ with chromatic number $\\aleph_1$ such that every strictly smaller subgraph has chromatic number $\\leq \\aleph_0$ as follows: the vertices of $G$ are the pairs $(x_\\alpha,y_\\beta)$ for $1\\leq \\alpha,\\beta <\\omega_1$, ordered lexicographically. We connect $(x_{\\alpha_1},y_{\\beta_1})$ and $(x_{\\alpha_2},y_{\\beta_2})$ if and only if $\\alpha_1<\\alpha_2$ and $\\beta_1<\\beta_2$. A similar construction produces a graph on $\\omega_2^2$ with chromatic number $\\aleph_2$ such that every smaller subgraph has chromatic number $\\leq \\aleph_1$.

In particular the asymptotics of $g_k(n)$ are known; in \\cite{Er69b} Erdos discussed the second order terms, and this question is implicit (especially when compared to the explicit question [425] he asked on several occasions). In \\cite{Er69} this question actually appears with a denominator of $(\\log n)^2$ in the second term. Furthermore, for $k=3$ he claims he could prove the existence of some $0<c_1\\leq c_2$ such that $ \\frac{\\log\\log n}{\\log n}n+c_1\\frac{n}{(\\log n)^2}\\leq g_3(n)\\leq \\frac{\\log\\log n}{\\log n}n+c_2\\frac{n}{(\\log n)^2}. $ This is strange, since in \\cite{Er64d} both the upper and lower bound techniques that he used in fact prove $ \\frac{\\log\\log n}{\\log n}n+c_1\\frac{n}{\\log n}\\leq g_3(n)\\leq \\frac{\\log\\log n}{\\log n}n+c_2\\frac{n}{\\log n} $ for some constants $0<c_1\\leq c_2$.

The problem above is from \\cite{Er77c}. This question is stated slightly differently in \\cite{ErGr80}, which has $a_0=n$ instead of $a_0=0$ and $1\\leq i<k$ instead of $0\\leq i<k$. The material difference this makes is that the main formulation above has $(a_k,n)=1$ for all $k\\geq 1$, which is not imposed in the second formulation. Furthermore, in both \\cite{Er77c} and \\cite{ErGr80} this is stated without the restriction to $a_k<n$ in the sum, although perhaps this was implicitly intended. Without this condition the sum is infinite since the sequence of $a_k$ contains $n+p$ for all primes $p>n$ (this observation was made by Svyable using ChatGPT). Unfortunately, although both sources mention a forthcoming paper of Eggleton, Erdos, and Selfridge, I cannot find a candidate paper of theirs with this problem in, and hence the motivation behind this problem, and what the precise problem intended was, is unclear. Chojecki has noted in the comments that a positive solution to the main problem would follow if $ f(n) = \\sum_{a<n}1_{P^-(n-a)>a}\\frac{1}{a}\\to \\infty, $ where $P^-(\\cdot)$ is the least prime factor.

The argument is very simple: every pair of points determines at most $2$ unit circles, and the claimed bound follows from double counting. Erdos claims in a number of places this produces the upper bound $n(n-1)$, but Harborth and Mengerson \\cite{HaMe86} note that in fact this delivers an upper bound of $\\frac{n(n-1)}{3}$. Elekes \\cite{El84} has a simple construction of a set with $\\gg n^{3/2}$ such circles. This may be the correct order of magnitude. In \\cite{Er75h} and \\cite{Er92e} Erdos also asks how many such unit circles there must be if the points are in general position.
