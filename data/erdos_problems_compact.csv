1878,"EP-1","Erdős Problem #1","If $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ with $\lvert A\rvert=n$ is such that the subset sums $\sum_{a\in S}a$ are distinct for all $S\subseteq A$ then $ N \gg 2^{n}. $","Erdos called this 'perhaps my first serious problem' (in \cite{Er98} he dates it to 1931). The powers of $2$ show that $2^n$ would be best possible here. The trivial lower bound is $N \gg 2^{n}/n$, since all $2^n$ distinct subset sums must lie in $[0,Nn)$. Erdos and Moser \cite{Er56} proved $ N\geq (\tfrac{1}{4}-o(1))\frac{2^n}{\sqrt{n}}. $ (In \cite{Er85c} Erdos offered \$100 for any improvement of the constant $1/4$ here.) A number of improvements of the constant have been given (see \cite{St23} for a history), with the current record $\sqrt{2/\pi}$ first proved in unpublished work of Elkies and Gleason. Two proofs achieving this constant are provided by Dubroff, Fox, and Xu \cite{DFX21}, who in fact prove the exact bound $N\geq \binom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}$. In \cite{Er73} and \cite{ErGr80} the generalisation where $A\subseteq (0,N]$ is a set of real numbers such that the subset sums all differ by at least $1$ is proposed, with the same conjectured bound. (The second proof of \cite{DFX21} applies also to this generalisation.) This generalisation seems to have first appeared in \cite{Gr71}. This problem appears in Erdos' book with Spencer \cite{ErSp74} in the final chapter titled 'The kitchen sink'. As Ruzsa writes in \cite{Ru99} ""it is a rich kitchen where such things go to the sink"". The sequence of minimal $N$ for a given $n$ is A276661 in the OEIS. See also [350].

1879,"EP-3","Erdős Problem #3","If $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has $\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}=\infty$ then must $A$ contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions?","This is essentially asking for good bounds on $r_k(N)$, the size of the largest subset of $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ without a non-trivial $k$-term arithmetic progression. For example, a bound like $ r_k(N) \ll_k \frac{N}{(\log N)(\log\log N)^2} $ would be sufficient. Even the case $k=3$ is non-trivial, but was proved by Bloom and Sisask \cite{BlSi20}. Much better bounds for $r_3(N)$ were subsequently proved by Kelley and Meka \cite{KeMe23}. Green and Tao \cite{GrTa17} proved $r_4(N)\ll N/(\log N)^{c}$ for some small constant $c>0$. Gowers \cite{Go01} proved $ r_k(N) \ll \frac{N}{(\log\log N)^{c_k}}, $ where $c_k>0$ is a small constant depending on $k$. The current best bounds for general $k$ are due to Leng, Sah, and Sawhney \cite{LSS24}, who show that $ r_k(N) \ll \frac{N}{\exp((\log\log N)^{c_k})} $ for some constant $c_k>0$ depending on $k$. Curiously, Erdos \cite{Er83c} thought this conjecture was the 'only way to approach' the conjecture that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers, now a theorem due to Green and Tao \cite{GrTa08} (see [219]). In \cite{Er81} Erdos makes the stronger conjecture that $ r_k(N) \ll_C\frac{N}{(\log N)^C} $ for every $C>0$ (now known for $k=3$ due to Kelley and Meka \cite{KeMe23}) - see [140].

1885,"EP-15","Erdős Problem #15","Is it true that $ \sum_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^n\frac{n}{p_n} $ converges, where $p_n$ is the sequence of primes?","Erdos suggested that a computer could be used to explore this, and did not see any other method to attack this. Tao \cite{Ta23} has proved that this series does converge assuming a strong form of the Hardy-Littlewood prime tuples conjecture. In \cite{Er98} Erdos further conjectures that $ \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{1}{n(p_{n+1}-p_n)} $ converges and $ \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{1}{p_{n+1}-p_n} $ diverges. Weisenberg notes that the existence of infinitely many bounded gaps between primes (as proved by Zhang \cite{Zh14}) implies the latter series does not converge. Weisenberg also has an argument which shows that, assuming the Hardy-Littlewood prime $k$-tuples conjecture, the series is unbounded in at least one direction (positive or negative). Erdos further conjectured that $ \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{1}{n(p_{n+1}-p_n)(\log\log n)^c} $ converges for every $c>0$, and reports that he and Nathanson can prove that this series converges absolutely for $c>2$ (and can show, conditional on 'hopeless' conjectures about the primes, that this sum does not converge absolutely for $c=2$). Sawhney has provided the following proof that this series converges absolutely for $c>2$: note that, whenever $c>1$, the contribution to the sum from gaps $p_{n+1}-p_n\geq \log n$ is convergent, so it suffices to consider only small gaps. The number of $n\leq X$ such that $p_{n+1}-p_n\in [\epsilon\log n,2\epsilon \log n)$ is bounded above by $\ll \epsilon X$ (this can be proved via the Selberg sieve). In particular, applying this bound for $\frac{1}{\log n}\leq \epsilon \leq 1$ of the shape $2^{-j}$ (of which there are at most $\log\log n$ possibilities) shows the desired convergence, since $ \sum \frac{1}{n(\log n)(\log\log n)^{c-1}} $ converges.

Both proofs in fact give $ h(N) \leq N^{1/2}+N^{1/4}+1. $ Balogh, F""{u}redi, and Roy \cite{BFR21} improved the bound in the error term to $0.998N^{1/4}$. This was further optimised by O'Bryant \cite{OB22}. The current record is $ h(N)\leq N^{1/2}+0.98183N^{1/4}+O(1), $ due to Carter, Hunter, and O'Bryant \cite{CHO25}. Singer \cite{Si38} was the first to show that $h(N)\geq (1-o(1))N^{1/2}$ for all $N$. For a detailed survey of the literature we refer to \cite{OB04}. See also [241] and [840].

Erdos and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{ErSz83} proved a lower bound of $\lvert A\rvert^{1+c}$ for some constant $c>0$, and an upper bound of $ \lvert A\rvert^2 \exp\left(-c\frac{\log\lvert A\rvert}{\log\log \lvert A\rvert}\right) $ for some constant $c>0$. The lower bound has been improved a number of times. The current record is $ \max( \lvert A+A\rvert,\lvert AA\rvert)\gg\lvert A\rvert^{\frac{1270}{951}-o(1)} $ due to Bloom \cite{Bl25} (note $1270/951=1.33543\cdots$). A complete history of sum-product bounds can be found at this webpage. There is likely nothing special about the integers in this question, and indeed Erdos and Szemer\'{e}di also ask a similar question about finite sets of real or complex numbers. The current best bound for sets of reals is the same bound of Bloom above. The best bound for complex numbers is $ \max( \lvert A+A\rvert,\lvert AA\rvert)\gg\lvert A\rvert^{\frac{4}{3}+c} $ for some absolute constant $c>0$, due to Basit and Lund \cite{BaLu19}. One can in general ask this question in any setting where addition and multiplication are defined (once one avoids any trivial obstructions such as zero divisors or finite subfields). For example, it makes sense for subsets of finite fields. The current record is that there exists $c>0$ such that if $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ with $\lvert A\rvert <p^{c}$ then $ \max( \lvert A+A\rvert,\lvert AA\rvert)\gg\lvert A\rvert^{\frac{5}{4}+o(1)}, $ due to Mohammadi and Stevens \cite{MoSt23}. There is also a natural generalisation to higher-fold sum and product sets. For example, in \cite{ErSz83} (and in \cite{Er91}) Erdos and Szemer\'{e}di also conjecture that for any $m\geq 2$ and finite set of integers $A$ $ \max( \lvert mA\rvert,\lvert A^m\rvert)\gg \lvert A\rvert^{m-o(1)}. $ See [53] for more on this generalisation and [808] for a stronger form of the original conjecture.

He also offered \$1000 for a proof that the limit does not exist, but says 'this is really a joke as [it] certainly exists'. (In \cite{Er88} he raises this prize to \$10000). Erdos proved $ \sqrt{2}\leq \liminf_{k\to \infty}R(k)^{1/k}\leq \limsup_{k\to \infty}R(k)^{1/k}\leq 4. $ The upper bound has been improved to $4-\tfrac{1}{128}$ by Campos, Griffiths, Morris, and Sahasrabudhe \cite{CGMS23}. This was improved to $3.7992\cdots$ by Gupta, Ndiaye, Norin, and Wei \cite{GNNW24}. A shorter and simpler proof of an upper bound of the strength $4-c$ for some constant $c>0$ (and a generalisation to the case of more than two colours) was given by Balister, Bollob\'{a}s, Campos, Griffiths, Hurley, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba \cite{BBCGHMST24}. In \cite{Er93} Erdos writes 'I have no idea what the value of $\lim R(k)^{1/k}$ should be, perhaps it is $2$ but we have no real evidence for this.' This problem is #3 in Ramsey Theory in the graphs problem collection. See also [1029] for a problem concerning a lower bound for $R(k)$ and discussion of lower bounds in general. A famous quote of Erdos concerns the difficulty of finding exact values for $R(k)$. This is often repeated in the words of Spencer, who phrased it as an alien attacking race. The earliest such quote in a paper of Erdos I have found is in \cite{Er93}, where he writes: 'Sometime ago, I made the following joke. If an evil spirit would appear and say ""unless you give me the value of $R(5)$ within a year, I will exterminate humanity"", then our best bet would be perhaps to get all our computers working on $R(5)$ and we probably would get its value in a year. If he would ask for $R(6)$, the best strategy probably would be to destroy it before it can destroy us. If we would be so clever that we could give the answer by mathematics, we would just tell him: ""if you try to do something you will see what will happent to you..."". I think we are strong enugh now and the only evil spirit we have to feel is the one which is in ourselves (quoting somebody: I have seen the enemy and them are us).

The methods of the upper bound proof of Spencer, Szemer\'{e}di, and Trotter \cite{SST84} generalise to include this metric. Therefore to prove an upper bound better than $n^{4/3}$ some special feature of the Euclidean metric must be exploited.

Note that when $r=k=2$ we recover the classic Ramsey numbers. Erdos thought it likely that for all $r,k\geq 2$ there exists some $C_1,C_2>1$ (depending only on $r$) such that $ C_1^{n^{1/k-1}}< R(n;k,r) < C_2^{n^{1/k-1}}. $ Antonio Girao has pointed out that this problem as written is easily disproved, and indeed $R(n;3,2) \geq C^{n}$: The obvious probabilistic construction (randomly colour the edges red/blue independently uniformly at random) yields a 2-colouring of the edges of $K_N$ such every set on $n$ vertices contains a red triangle and a blue triangle (using that every set of $n$ vertices contains $\gg n^2$ edge-disjoint triangles), provided $N \leq C^n$ for some absolute constant $C>1$. This implies $R(n;3,2) \geq C^{n}$, contradicting the conjecture. Perhaps Erdos had a different problem in mind, but it is not clear what that might be. It would presumably be one where the natural probabilistic argument would deliver a bound like $C^{\sqrt{n}}$ as Erdos and Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s claim to have achieved via the probabilistic method.","open",3,1

This is equivalent to asking whether the chromatic number of the square of the line graph $L(G)^2$ is at most $\frac{5}{4}\Delta^2$. This bound would be the best possible, as witnessed by a blowup of $C_5$. The minimum number of such sets required is sometimes called the strong chromatic index of $G$. The weaker conjecture that there exists some $c>0$ such that $(2-c)\Delta^2$ sets suffice was proved by Molloy and Reed \cite{MoRe97}, who proved that $1.998\Delta^2$ sets suffice (for $\Delta$ sufficiently large).

Erdos observed that colouring according to whether $\{ \sqrt{2}n\}<1/2$ or not implies $f(d) \ll d$ (using the fact that $\|\sqrt{2}q\| \gg 1/q$ for all $q$, where $\|x\|$ is the distance to the nearest integer).

This was disproved by Simonovits and S\'{o}s \cite{SiSo81}, who observed that taking all sets containing at most $3$ elements, containing some fixed element, produces $\binom{N}{2}+1$ many such sets, which is asymptotically greater than the number of arithmetic progressions containing a fixed element, which is $\sim \frac{\pi^2}{24}N^2$. If we drop the non-empty requirement then Graham, Simonovits, and S\'{o}s \cite{GSS80} have shown that $ t\leq \binom{N}{3}+\binom{N}{2}+\binom{N}{1}+1 $ and this is best possible.

This problem asks whether one can have a composite Lucas sequence without 'an underlying system of covering congruences responsible'. This problem has been 'conjecturally solved' by Ismailescu and Son \cite{IsSo14}, in that they provide an explicit infinite Lucas sequence in which all the terms are composite, and believe that no covering system is responsible for this.

The assumption implies $\sum \frac{1}{n_i}=\infty$. If the $n_i$ are pairwise relatively prime then it is sufficient that $\sum \frac{1}{n_i}=\infty$. This is true - a proof is given in the comments by Somani (using ChatGPT). An alternative elementary proof was noted by KoishiChan in the comments: let $\delta$ be the lower density of the set of integers divisible by some $n\in A$, and $\delta_k$ be the density of the set of integers divisible by at least one of $n_1,\ldots,n_k$. A theorem of Davenport and Erdos \cite{DaEr36} states that $ \delta = \lim_{k\to \infty}\delta_k. $ In the present case $\delta=1$ and hence for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists $k$ such that $\delta_k>1-\epsilon$. In other words, the density of those integers not satisfying $a_i\equiv 0\pmod{n_i}$ for $1\leq i\leq k$ is $<\epsilon$. By a theorem of Rogers (which first appeared in print in Chapter V.3 of the book of Halberstam and Roth \cite{HaRo66}) the density of those integers not satisfying any of the congruences $a_i\pmod{n_i}$ for $1\leq i\leq k$ is maximised when $a_i\equiv 0$, which concludes the proof.

More generally, if the leading digit of $n$ in base $p$ is $p-1$ then $p\mid (a_n,L_n)$. There is in fact a necessary and sufficient condition: a prime $p\leq n$ divides $(a_n,L_n)$ if and only if $p$ divides the numerator of $1+\cdots+\frac{1}{k}$, where $k$ is the leading digit of $n$ in base $p$. This can be seen by writing $ a_n = \frac{L_n}{1}+\cdots+\frac{L_n}{n} $ and observing that the right-hand side is congruent to $1+\cdots+1/k$ modulo $p$. (The previous claim about $p-1$ follows immediately from Wolstenholme's theorem.) This leads to a heuristic prediction (see for example a preprint of Shiu \cite{Sh16}) of $\asymp\frac{x}{\log x}$ for the number of $n\in [1,x]$ such that $(a_n,L_n)=1$. In particular, there should be infinitely many $n$, but the set of such $n$ should have density zero. Unfortunately this heuristic is difficult to turn into a proof.

In \cite{Er78d} and \cite{Er83d} he speculated that perhaps $C=4\pi/\sqrt{27}\approx 2.418$ works, which would be the best possible, as witnessed by a circle of radius $<2\cdot 3^{-3/4}$. Further evidence for this is given by a result of Freiling and Mauldin \cite{Ma02}, who proved that if $A$ has outer measure $>4\pi/\sqrt{27}$ then $A$ contains the vertices of a triangle with area $>1$. This also proves the same threshold for the original problem under the assumption that $A$ is a compact convex set. Mauldin also discusses this problem in \cite{Ma13}, in which he notes that it suffices to prove this under the assumption that $A$ is the union of the interiors of $n<\infty$ many compact convex sets. Freiling and Mauldin (see \cite{Ma13}) have proved this conjecture if $1\leq n\leq 3$.

He later \cite{He91} proved that, for any fixed $\alpha>0$, the set of $\beta$ for which this holds either has measure $0$ or infinite measure. In \cite{He94} he proved that the set of $(\alpha,\beta)$ for which the corresponding set of sums does not contain an infinite arithmetic progression has cardinality continuum.

How does $f(n)$ grow? Is $f(n)=o(n)$?","Asked by Erdos and Harzheim. In \cite{Er77c} Erdos asks about an infinite such set of integers, and whether such a set must have density $0$. He notes that a simple averaging process implies $a_k \gg k\log k$ for infinitely many $k$, and so the lower density is $0$. He also asks whether $\sum\frac{1}{a_k}$ must converge. Weisenberg in the comments observes that any set which satisfies [874] also has this property, which implies $f(n)\geq (2+o(1))n^{1/2}$. If $g(n)$ is the maximal $k$ such that there are $1\leq a_1,\ldots,a_k\leq n$ with all consecutive sums distinct (i.e. we drop the monotonicity assumption in the definition of $f$) then Hegyv\'{a}ri \cite{He86} has proved that $ \left(\frac{1}{3}+o(1)\right) n\leq g(n)\leq \left(\frac{2}{3}+o(1)\right)n. $ The upper bound of Coppersmith and Phillips in [867] implies $ g(n) \leq \left(\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{512}+o(1)\right)n. $ A similar question can be asked if we replace strict monotonicity with weak monotonicity (i.e. we allow $a_i=a_j$). Erdos and Harzheim also ask what is the least $m$ which is not a sum of the given form? Can it be much larger than $n$? Erdos and Harzheim can show that $\sum_{x<a_i<x^2}\frac{1}{a_i}\ll 1$.

Or even where $f(n)\geq 2$ for all large $n$?","When $a_n=n$ the function $f(n)$ counts the number of odd divisors of $n$. In modern language, this asks for the existence of a convex set $A$ such that $1_A\circ 1_A(n)\to \infty$ as $n\to \infty$. Erdos and Moser \cite{Mo63} considered the case when $A$ is the set of primes, and conjectured that the $\limsup$ of the number of such representations in this case is infinite. They could not even prove that the upper density of the set of integers representable in this form is positive. In \cite{ErGr80} they further asked whether $f(n)\geq 1$ for all large $n$ is possible, but Egami observed the answer to this is trivially yes, taking $a_n=n$. Perhaps they intended to restrict $f(n)$ to only count those representatives as the sum of at least two consecutive terms. (It is a classical fact that $n$ can be expressed as a sum of at least two consecutive positive integers if and only if $n eq 2^k$.) In \cite{Er77c} Erdos writes 'This problem can perhaps be rightly criticized as being artificial and in the backwater of Mathematics but it seems very strange and attractive to me'.

In other words, for all $\epsilon>0$, there are infinitely many $n$ such that $\binom{2n}{n}$ is coprime to $p_1p_2p_3$, except for a factor of size $\leq n^\epsilon$. This is mentioned in problem B33 of Guy's collection \cite{Gu04}. It is also discussed in an article of Pomerance \cite{Po15c}.

Cambie has observed that the first question boils down to some old conjectures on prime gaps. By Cram\'{er's conjecture}, for every $\epsilon>0,$ for every $u$ sufficiently large there is a prime between $u$ and $u+u^\epsilon$. Thus for $u+u^\epsilon<v$, the largest prime divisor of \( \prod_{u \leq m \leq v} m \) appears with exponent $1$. Since this is not the case in the question, \( v - u = v^{o(1)} \). Cambie also gives the following heuristic for the second question. The 'probability' that the largest prime divisor of $n$ is $<n^{1/2}$ is $1-\log 2>0$. For any fixed $k$, there is therefore a positive 'probability' that there are $k$ consecutive integers around $q^2$ (for a prime $q$) all of whose prime divisors are bounded above by $q$, when $v-u\geq k$.

In \cite{ErGr80} (and in Guy's book) this problem as written is asking for whether almost all integers appear in this sequence, but the answer to this is trivially no (as pointed out to me by Steinerberger): no integer $\equiv 1\pmod{3}$ is ever in the sequence, so the set of integers which appear has density at most $2/3$. This is easily seen by induction, and the fact that if $a,b\in \{0,2\}\pmod{3}$ then $ab-1\in \{0,2\}\pmod{3}$.

Erdos had conjectured (see \cite{Er73} and \cite{Er77c}) that $\lvert A\rvert=o(x)$. In \cite{ErGr80} Erdos and Graham report that Alexander had given a construction disproving this conjecture, establishing that $\lvert A\rvert\gg x$ is possible. Alexander's construction is given in \cite{Er80}, and we sketch a simplified version. Let $B\subseteq [1,X^2]$ be a Sidon set of integers of size $\gg X$ and $ A=\{ X e^{b/X^2} : b\in B\}. $ It is easy to check that $ \lvert ab-cd\rvert \geq X^2\lvert 1-e^{1/X^2}\rvert \gg 1 $ for distinct $a,b,c,d\in A$, and (after rescaling $A$ by some constant factor) this produces a set of size $\gg X$ with the desired property in the interval $[X,O(X)]$. Furthermore, a simple modification allows for $A$ to also be $1$-separated. In \cite{Er77c} Erdos considers a similar generalisation for sets of complex numbers or complex integers.

The problem above is from \cite{Er77c}. This question is stated slightly differently in \cite{ErGr80}, which has $a_0=n$ instead of $a_0=0$ and $1\leq i<k$ instead of $0\leq i<k$. The material difference this makes is that the main formulation above has $(a_k,n)=1$ for all $k\geq 1$, which is not imposed in the second formulation. Furthermore, in both \cite{Er77c} and \cite{ErGr80} this is stated without the restriction to $a_k<n$ in the sum, although perhaps this was implicitly intended. Without this condition the sum is infinite since the sequence of $a_k$ contains $n+p$ for all primes $p>n$ (this observation was made by Svyable using ChatGPT). Unfortunately, although both sources mention a forthcoming paper of Eggleton, Erdos, and Selfridge, I cannot find a candidate paper of theirs with this problem in, and hence the motivation behind this problem, and what the precise problem intended was, is unclear. Chojecki has noted in the comments that a positive solution to the main problem would follow if $ f(n) = \sum_{a<n}1_{P^-(n-a)>a}\frac{1}{a}\to \infty, $ where $P^-(\cdot)$ is the least prime factor. Standard estimates on rough numbers show that $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n\leq N}f(n)\gg \log\log N$, so $f(n)$ does diverge on average, but it is unclear whether $f(n)\to \infty$ for all $n$.

2172,"EP-552","Erdős Problem #552","Determine the Ramsey number $ R(C_4,S_n), $ where $S_n=K_{1,n}$ is the star on $n+1$ vertices. In particular, is it true that, for any $c>0$, there are infinitely many $n$ such that $ R(C_4,S_n)\leq n+\sqrt{n}-c? $","A problem of Burr, Erdos, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp \cite{BEFRS89}. Erdos often asked about $R(C_4,S_n)$ in the equivalent formulation of asking for a bound on the minimum degree of a graph which would guarantee the existence of a $C_4$ (see [85]). It is known that $ n+\sqrt{n}-6n^{11/40} \leq R(C_4,S_n)\leq n+\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil+1. $ The lower bound is due to \cite{BEFRS89}, the upper bound is due to Parsons \cite{Pa75}. The lower bound of \cite{BEFRS89} is related to gaps between primes, and assuming e.g. Cramer's conjecture on gaps between primes their lower bound would be $n+\sqrt{n}-n^{o(1)}$. Erdos offered \$100 for a proof or disproof of the second question in \cite{BEFRS89}. In \cite{Er96} Erdos asks (an equivalent formulation of) whether $R(C_4,S_n)\geq n+\sqrt{n}-O(1)$, but says this is probably 'too optimistic'. They also ask, if $f(n)=R(C_4,S_n)$, whether $f(n+1)=f(n)$ infinitely often, and is the density of such $n$ $0$? Also, is it true that $f(n+1)\leq f(n)+2$ for all $n$? A similar question about an equivalent function is the subject of [85]. Parsons \cite{Pa75} proved that $ R(C_4,S_n)=n+\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil $ whenever $n=q^2+1$ for a prime power $q$ and $ R(C_4,S_n)=n+\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil+1 $ whenever $n=q^2$ for a prime power $q$ (in particular both equalities occur infinitely often). This has been extended in various works, all in the cases $n=q^2\pm t$ for some $0\leq t\leq q$ and prime power $q$. We refer to the work of Parsons \cite{Pa76}, Wu, Sun, Zhang, and Radziszowski \cite{WSZR15}, and Zhang, Chen, and Cheng (\cite{ZCC17} and \cite{ZCC17b}) for a precise description. In every known case $ R(C_4,S_n)=n+\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil+\{0,1\}, $ and Zhang, Chen, and Cheng \cite{ZCC17} speculate whether this is in fact true for all $n\geq 2$ (whence the answer to the question above would be no).

At a conference on random graphs in Poznan, Poland (most likely in 1989) Erdos offered \$100 for a proof that this is true, and \$1000 for a proof that this is false (although later told Gimbel that \$1000 was perhaps too much).

Find a necessary and sufficient condition on $A$ for $M_A$ to have density $1$.","A sequence $A$ for which $M_A$ has density $1$ is called a Behrend sequence. If $A$ is a set of prime numbers (or, more generally, a set of pairwise coprime integers without $1$) then a necessary and sufficient condition is that $\sum_{p\in A}\frac{1}{p}=\infty$. The general situation is more complicated. For example suppose $A$ is the union of $(n_k,(1+\eta_k)n_k)\cap \mathbb{Z}$ where $1\leq n_1<n_2<\cdots$ is a lacunary sequence. (This construction is sometimes called a block sequence.) If $\sum \eta_k<\infty$ then the density of $M_A$ exists and is $<1$. If $\eta_k=1/k$, so $\sum \eta_k=\infty$, then the density exists and is $<1$. Erdos writes it 'seems certain' that there is some threshold $\alpha\in (0,1)$ such that, if $\eta_k=k^{-\beta}$, then the density of $M_A$ is $1$ if $\beta <\alpha$ and the density is $<1$ if $\beta >\alpha$. Tenenbaum notes in \cite{Te96} that this is certainly not true as written since if the $n_j$ grow sufficiently quickly then this sequence is never Behrend, for any choice of $\eta_k$. He then writes 'we understand from subsequent discussions with Erdos that he had actually in mind a two-sided condition on' $n_{j+1}/n_j$.

We have an edge $u\sim v$ if and only if $uv\in A$. It is easy to see that every $m\leq n$ can be written as $uv$ where $u\leq n^{2/3}$ and $v$ is either prime or $\leq n^{2/3}$, and hence there are $\geq \lvert A\rvert$ many edges. This graph contains no path of length $3$ and hence must be a tree and have fewer edges than vertices, and we are done. This can be improved to give the upper bound mentioned by using a subset of integers in $[1,n^{2/3}]$. More generally, one can ask for such an asymptotic for the size of sets such that no $a\in A$ divides the product of $r$ distinct other elements of $A$, with the exponent $2/3$ replaced by $\frac{2}{r+1}$.

In particular the asymptotics of $g_k(n)$ are known; in \cite{Er69b} Erdos discussed the second order terms, and this question is implicit (especially when compared to the explicit question [425] he asked on several occasions). In \cite{Er69} this question actually appears with a denominator of $(\log n)^2$ in the second term. Furthermore, for $k=3$ he claims he could prove the existence of some $0<c_1\leq c_2$ such that $ \frac{\log\log n}{\log n}n+c_1\frac{n}{(\log n)^2}\leq g_3(n)\leq \frac{\log\log n}{\log n}n+c_2\frac{n}{(\log n)^2}. $ This is strange, since in \cite{Er64d} both the upper and lower bound techniques that he used in fact prove $ \frac{\log\log n}{\log n}n+c_1\frac{n}{\log n}\leq g_3(n)\leq \frac{\log\log n}{\log n}n+c_2\frac{n}{\log n} $ for some constants $0<c_1\leq c_2$. My best guess is that the denominator of $(\log n)^2$ in \cite{Er69} is just an unfortunate repeated typo, and $\log n$ was intended in both the reported bounds and the main question. This correction is thanks to Tang, who noted independently (see the comments) the improved lower bound given above (indeed with an improvement in the constant $c_1$).

In other words, this problem asks for an upper bound for the abundancy index of weird numbers. This could be true with $C=3$. We must have $C>2$ since $\sigma(70)=144$ but $70$ is not the distinct sum of integers from $\{1,2,5,7,10,14,35\}$. Erdos suggested that as $C\to \infty$ only divisors at most $\epsilon n$ need to be used, where $\epsilon \to 0$. Weisenberg has observed that if $n$ is a weird number with an abundancy index $\geq 4$ then it is divisible by an odd weird number. In particular, if there are no odd weird numbers (see [470]) then every weird number has abundancy index $<4$. Indeed, if $l(n)$ is the abundancy index and $n=2^km$ with $m$ odd then $l(n)=l(2^k)l(m)$, and $l(2^k)<2$ so if $l(n)\geq 4$ then $l(m)>2$, and hence $m$ is weird (as a factor of a weird number).

Erdos and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Bermond, Bond, Paoli, and Peyrat \cite{BBPP83} independently conjectured that $h_2(d) \leq \tfrac{5}{4}d^2+1$, with equality for even $d$ (see [149]). This was proved by Chung, Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s, Tuza, and Trotter \cite{CGTT90}.

Lattanzio \cite{La02} proved there exist such graphs for all $k$ such that $k-1$ is not prime. Independently, Jensen \cite{Je02} gave an alternative construction for all $k\geq 5$.

What is it?","Questions raised by Erdos, Hardy, and Subbarao, who called the set $S$ 'EHS numbers' and the set $P$ 'Pillai primes', and proved that both $S$ and $P$ are infinite. Pillai \cite{Pi30} raised the question of whether there exist any primes in $P$. This was answered by Chowla, who noted that, for example, $ 14!+1\equiv 18!+1\equiv 0\pmod{23}. $ The sequence $S$ begins $ 8,9,13,14,15,16,17,\ldots $ and is A064164 in the OEIS. The sequence $P$ begins $ 23,29,59,61,67,71,\ldots $ and is A063980 in the OEIS. Regarding the first question, Hardy and Subbarao computed all EHS numbers up to $2^{10}$, and write '...if this trend conditions we expect [the limit] to be around $0.5$, if it exists. The frequency with which the EHS numbers occur - most often in long sequences of consecutive integers - makes us believe that their asymptotic density exists and is unity. Erdos, though initially hesitant, later agreed with this view.' Regarding the second question, they write '[from the data] it would appear that if the limit exists, it is perhaps between $0.5$ and $0.6$. But then there seems to be no reason why the ratio should not tend to $1$, even though very slowly and certainly not monotonically.' This is discussed in problem A2 of Guy's collection \cite{Gu04}.

They speculate that the threshold may be $q_0$, where $q_0\approx 1.3247$ is the real root of $x^3=x+1$, and is the smallest Pisot-Vijayaraghavan number. In \cite{EJK90} Erd\H{o}, Jo\'{o}, and Komornik prove that any Pisot-Vijayaraghavan number cannot have this property, and also prove that, for any $1<q\leq 2$, $x_{k+1}-x_k\leq 1$ for all $k$. The sequence always begins $0,1,q$.

Erdos, Jo\'{o}, and Schnitzer \cite{EJS96} improved this to show that, if $1<q<(1+\sqrt{5})/2$, then $q$ is a Pisot-Vijayaraghavan number if and only if $ \liminf (x_{k+1}^2-x_k^2)>0. $ References [Bu96] Bugeaud, Y., On a property of {P}isot numbers and related questions.

Are there always $O(n^{3/2})$ many such $d$?","A problem Erdos posed in the 1989 problem session of Great Western Number Theory. He states that Erdos and Ruzsa gave an explicit construction which achieved $n^{1+c}$ for some $c>0$, and Erdos and Spencer gave a probabilistic proof which achieved $n^{3/2}$, and speculated this may be the best possible. In the comment section, Chan has noticed that this problem is exactly equivalent to a sums-differences question of Bourgain \cite{Bo99}, introduced as an arithmetic path towards the Kakeya conjecture: find the smallest $c\in [1,2]$ such that, for any finite sets of integers $A$ and $B$ and $G\subseteq A\times B$ we have $ \lvert A\overset{G}{-}B\rvert \ll \max(\lvert A\rvert,\lvert B\rvert, \lvert A\overset{G}{+}B\rvert)^c $ (where, for example, $A\overset{G}{+}B$ denotes the set of $a+b$ with $(a,b)\in G$). This is equivalent in the sense that the greatest exponent $c$ achievable for the main problem here is equal to the smallest constant achievable for the sums-differences question. The current best bounds known are thus $ 1.77898\cdots \leq c \leq 11/6 \approx 1.833. $ The upper bound is due to Katz and Tao \cite{KaTa99}.

How fast must $A$ grow?","Erdos notes there exists such a sequence which grows exponentially, but does not expect such a sequence of polynomial growth. In \cite{Er81h} he asked whether there is an infinite sequence of integers $A$ such that, for every $a\in A$ and prime $p$, if $ a\equiv t\pmod{p^2} $ then $1\leq t<p^2/2$. He noted that such a sequence has the property that every $n\in A+A$ is squarefree. He wrote 'I am doubtful if such a sequence exists. I formulated this problem while writing these lines and must ask the indulgence of the reader if it turns out to be trivial.' Indeed, there are trivially at most finitely many such $a$, since there cannot be any primes $p\in (a^{1/2},(2a)^{1/2}]$, but there exist primes in $(x,\sqrt{2}x)$ for all large $x$. If $A=\{a_1<a_2<\cdots\}$ is such a sequence then van Doorn and Tao \cite{vDTa25} have shown that $a_j > 0.24j^{4/3}$ for all $j$, and further that there exists such a sequence (furthermore with squarefree terms) such that $ a_j < \exp(5j/\log j) $ for all large $j$. A superior lower bound of $a_j \gg j^{15/11-o(1)}$ had earlier been found by Konyagin \cite{Ko04} when considering the finite case [1109].

He wrote 'I mistakenly thought that this was a nice and difficult conjecture but Jansen and several others found a simple proof by induction.' This simple proof is as follows: one proves the stronger fact that such a representation always exists, and moreover if $n$ is even then all the summands can be taken to be even: if $n=2m$ we are done applying the inductive hypothesis to $m$. Otherwise if $n$ is odd then let $3^k$ be the largest power of $3$ which is $\leq n$ and apply the inductive hypothesis to $n-3^k$ (which is even).

Bollob\'{a}s, Hegyv\'{a}ri, and Jin \cite{BHJ97} provide a negative answer in that, for any sequence of integers $1\leq r_1<r_2<\cdots$, there is a $B$ as above with $b_{i+1}\geq r_ib_i$ such that $(A+A+A)\cap B eq\emptyset$ for any $A$ with $2\leq a_{i+1}-a_i\leq 3$. They define, more generally, $r_k(d_1,d_2)$ as the smallest $r$ (if it exists) such that if $b_{i+1}\geq rb_i$ then there exists $A$ with $d_1\leq a_{i+1}-a_i\leq d_2$ such that $(kA)\cap B=\emptyset$, where $kA$ is the $k$-fold sumset. It follows from the above results that $r_2(2,3)=2$ and that $r_3(2,3)$ does not exist. Chen \cite{Ch00} proved that $r_2(a,b)\leq 2$ for any integers $a<b$ with $b eq 2a$, and that $r_2(a,2a)\geq 2$ for all integers $a$. The more general question of existence of $r_k(a,b)$ for $k\geq 3$ remains open. Some further technical non-existence results are given by Tang and Yang \cite{TaYa21}. [Note the stated problem is a generous interpretation of a very ambiguous remark in \cite{ErGr80}, so it might be more appropriate to call this a problem 'inspired by Erdos and Graham'.] References [BHJ97] Bollob\'as, B\'{e}la and Hegyv\'ari, Norbert and Jin, Guoping, On a problem of {E}rd\H{o}s and {G}raham.

2500,"EP-1113","Erdős Problem #1113","A positive odd integer $m$ such that none of $2^km+1$ are prime for $k\geq 0$ is called a Sierpinski number. We say that a set of primes $P$ is a covering set for $m$ if every $2^km+1$ is divisible by some $p\in P$. Are there Sierpinski numbers with no finite covering set of primes?","Sierpinski \cite{Si60} proved that there are infinitely many Sierpinski numbers, using covering systems to construct suitable covering sets for any $m$ satisfying a certain congruence. This establishes that there is a positive density set of such $m$. The smallest Sierpinski number is believed to be $78557$, which was found by Selfridge. Erdos and Graham \cite{ErGr80} asked whether there are Sierpinski numbers for which a covering system is not 'responsible', for which the best interpretation seems to be the above question. This is formulated precisely in problem F13 of Guy's collection \cite{Gu04}. Erdos and Graham thought the answer is yes (in that there are such Sierpinski numbers), since otherwise this would imply there are infinitely many Fermat primes. There is now further evidence with a concrete example: an argument of Izotov \cite{Iz95}, given in more detail by Filaseta, Finch, and Kozek \cite{FFK08}, suggests that $m=734110615000775^4$ is a Sierpinski number without a covering set. (Izotov proved that this $m$ is indeed a Sierpinski number.) Filaseta, Finch, and Kozek \cite{FFK08} give a revised conjecture, suggesting that every Sierpinski number is either a perfect power or else has a finite covering set of primes. They also prove that for every $l\geq 1$ there is an $m$ such that $2^km^i+1$ is composite for all $1\leq i\leq l$ and $k\geq 0$. See also [203], and [276] for another problem in which the question is whether covering systems are always responsible.

Describe which choice of $x_i$ minimise $ \Lambda(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\max_{x\in [-1,1]} \sum_k \lvert l_k(x)\rvert. $","The functions $l_k(x)$ are sometimes called the fundamental functions of Lagrange interpolation, and $\Lambda$ is sometimes called the Lebesgue constant. Faber \cite{Fa14} proved $ \Lambda(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\gg \log n $ for all choices of $x_i$, and Bernstein \cite{Be31} proved it is $>(\frac{2}{\pi}-o(1))\log n$. Erdos \cite{Er61c} improved this to $ \Lambda(x_1,\ldots,x_n)> \frac{2}{\pi}\log n-O(1). $ This is best possible, since taking the $x_i$ as the roots of the $n$th Chebyshev polynomial yields $ \Lambda(x_1,\ldots,x_n)< \frac{2}{\pi}\log n+O(1). $ Erdos thought that the minimising choice is characterised by the property that the sums $ \lambda_i=\max_{x\in [x_i,x_{i+1}]}\sum_k \lvert l_k(x)\rvert $ are all equal for $0\leq i\leq n$ (where $x_0=-1$ and $x_{n+1}=1$). This conjecture was also made by Bernstein \cite{Be31}. Kilgore and Cheney \cite{KiCh76} proved that there exists $x_i$ for which all $\lambda_i$ are equal. Kilgore \cite{Ki77} proved that $\Lambda$ is minimised only when all $\lambda_i$ are equal. Finally, de Boor and Pinkus \cite{dBPi78} proved that there exists a unique minimising choice of $x_i$. If $x_1=-1$ and $x_n=1$ then there is a unique minimising set of $x_i$, which are symmetric around $0$. (Such a choice is called canonical.) The exact minimising canonical choice is known only for $n\leq 4$. For $n=2$ the points are $-1,1$ (with $\Lambda=1$). For $n=3$ the points are $-1,0,1$ (with $\Lambda=1.25$), as shown by Bernstein \cite{Be31}. Rack and Vajda \cite{RaVa15} have shown that for $n=4$ the points are $-1,-t,t,1$ where $t\approx 0.4177$ is an explicit algebraic constant (with $\Lambda \approx 1.4229$). In \cite{Er67} Erdos suggests that an easier variant might be to have the $x_i\in \mathbb{C}$ with $\lvert x_i\rvert=1$, and seek to minimise $\max_{\lvert z\rvert=1}\sum_{k}\lvert l_k(z)\rvert$, adding it 'seems certain' that the minimising $x_i$ are the $n$th roots of unity.
