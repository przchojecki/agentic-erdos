# EP-421 partial resolution

## Statement
Does there exist a density-one sequence `d_1<d_2<...` such that all products
`prod_{u<=i<=v} d_i` are distinct?

## What is resolved
Background cites a construction (Selfridge) achieving density greater than
`1/e - epsilon` for any fixed `epsilon>0`.

## What remains open in this note
The full density-one target is not achieved by the cited result.

## Status
- density near `1/e`: known.
- density `1` version: unresolved.
