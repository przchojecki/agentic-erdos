# EP-1091 partial resolution

## Statement split
1. If `G` is `K_4`-free with chromatic number `4`, must `G` contain an odd cycle
   with at least two diagonals?
2. More generally, is there `f(r)->infinity` such that every graph with chromatic
   number `4` and local condition `chi(H)<=3` for all `|V(H)|<=r` contains an odd
   cycle with at least `f(r)` diagonals?

## What is resolved
Background states the first question was solved affirmatively by Voss (1982).
So subquestion (1) is yes.

## What remains open in this note
The strengthened quantitative form (2) is not settled by the provided background.
Background also notes the pentagonal wheel shows three diagonals are not guaranteed,
so any such `f(r)` cannot force a uniform lower bound `>=3` at all scales.

## Status
- First subquestion: resolved (yes, by cited result).
- Second subquestion: unresolved here.
