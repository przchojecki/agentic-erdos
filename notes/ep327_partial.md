# EP-327 partial resolution

## Statement
For `A subseteq {1,...,N}` with pairwise divisibility constraint
`a+b | ab` (or variant `a+b | 2ab`), can `|A|` be substantially above the odd
numbers, and in the second variant must `|A|=o(N)`?

## What is resolved
Background records an elementary density upper bound for the first constraint:
if `|A| >= (25/28+o(1))N`, then forbidden pairs must occur.

## What remains open in this note
This does not determine the true maximum density for the first constraint, and
the second variant remains open in the cited text.

## Status
- nontrivial upper bound for first constraint: known.
- exact density and second-variant asymptotics: unresolved.
