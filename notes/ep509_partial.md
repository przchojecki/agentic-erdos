# EP-509 partial resolution

## Statement
Given monic non-constant `f in C[z]`, can

`{z in C : |f(z)| <= 1}`

always be covered by circles with total radius at most `2`?

## What is resolved
Background records progressive partial bounds:
- Cartan: total radius bound `2e`;
- Pommerenke (1961): improved to `2.59`;
- Pommerenke (1959): target constant `2` holds when the set is connected.

So the exact constant `2` is proved in a substantial special case (connected level
set), and the general case has a uniform bound strictly below `2e`.

## What remains open in this note
The unrestricted general-case bound `<=2` is not established by the provided
background.

## Status
- connected case: resolved with constant `2`.
- general case: unresolved (best listed bound `2.59`).
