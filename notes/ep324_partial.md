# EP-324 partial resolution

## Statement
Does there exist `f in Z[x]` such that all pair sums `f(a)+f(b)` for
`0<=a<b` are distinct?

## What is resolved
Background indicates that proving this for `f(x)=x^n` with `n>=5` would follow
from the Lander-Parkin-Selfridge conjecture.

A local computation in this workspace found no collisions for `f(x)=x^5` on the
range `0<=a<b<=1200` (720600 pairs checked).

## What remains open in this note
No unconditional proof is provided in the cited background.

## Status
- substantial heuristic and finite-range evidence: present.
- full theorem: unresolved.
