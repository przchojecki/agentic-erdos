# EP-603 partial resolution

## Statement
For countably-infinite sets `(A_i)` with `|A_i cap A_j| != 2`, find minimal
number of colors needed to avoid monochromatic `A_i`.

## What is resolved
Background gives the analogous `|A_i cap A_j| != 1` case: Komjath proved
countably many colors suffice.

## What remains open in this note
The exact minimum for the `!=2` intersection condition is not resolved by that
result.

## Status
- `!=1` intersection variant: solved with `aleph_0` colors.
- `!=2` target variant: unresolved.
