# EP-766 partial resolution

## Statement
For fixed (k,l), f(n;k,l)=min ex(n;G) over k-vertex l-edge graphs G. Estimate in
k<l<=k^2/4 and ask strict monotonicity in l for fixed k, large n.

## What is resolved
Background gives a concrete boundary estimate (Dirac-Erdos): for
l=floor(k^2/4)+1, f(n;k,l)<=floor(n^2/4)+1.

## What remains open in this note
Sharp estimates across the full interior range and strict monotonicity in l are not
resolved here.

## Status
- key boundary-case upper bound known.
- full range estimates and monotonicity open.
