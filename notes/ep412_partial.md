# EP-412 partial resolution

## Statement
For iterates of the divisor-sum map `sigma_i`, does every pair `m,n>=2` have
some collision `sigma_i(m)=sigma_j(n)`?

## What is resolved
Background records numerical evidence (Selfridge) suggesting the answer is no.

## What remains open in this note
No proof or counterexample is provided in the cited background.

## Status
- computational negative signal: present.
- rigorous resolution: open.
