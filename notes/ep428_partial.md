# EP-428 partial resolution

## Statement
Is there `A subset N` with positive lower prime-density profile such that for
infinitely many `n`, all numbers `n-a` (for relevant `a in A`) are prime?

## What is resolved
Background records a conditional result (prime k-tuple conjecture): the property
holds with `limsup` in place of `liminf`.

## What remains open in this note
The stronger lower-density (`liminf`) formulation is not resolved by the cited
conditional theorem.

## Status
- conditional `limsup` version: known.
- `liminf` positive-density version: unresolved.
