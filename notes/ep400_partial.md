# EP-400 partial resolution

## Statement
For `g_k(n)` defined via factorial-divisibility constraints, ask whether
`sum_{n<=x} g_k(n) ~ c_k x log x` and whether typical values satisfy
`g_k(n)=c_k log x + o(log x)` for almost all `n<x`.

## What is resolved
Background records the uniform upper bound `g_k(n) <<_k log n`.

## What remains open in this note
Best constants and distributional asymptotics are not settled by the cited
material.

## Status
- logarithmic-order upper bound: known.
- sharp constants and almost-all asymptotics: unresolved.
