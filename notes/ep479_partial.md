# EP-479 partial resolution

## Statement
For fixed `k != 1`, are there infinitely many `n` with
`2^n \equiv k (mod n)`?

## What is resolved
Background reports proofs for `k=2^i` (`i>=1`) and for `k=-1`.

A local scan up to `n<=10^6` found first witnesses for many small `k`
(examples: `k=5` at `n=19147`, `k=11` at `n=262279`), while not finding one for
`k=3` within that bound.

## What remains open in this note
General infinitude for arbitrary `k != 1` is not resolved by the cited material.

## Status
- several infinite families: resolved.
- full `k != 1` statement: unresolved.
