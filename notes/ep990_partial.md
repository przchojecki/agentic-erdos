# EP-990 partial resolution

## Statement
Discrepancy of root arguments for sparse polynomials: target bound scales like
sqrt(n log M) with n nonzero coefficients.

## What is resolved
Background says Erdos-Turan proved such a bound with n replaced by degree d.

## What remains open in this note
Replacing degree d by sparsity n in the same scale is not settled here.

## Status
- classical degree-based bound known.
- sparsity-refined bound unresolved.
