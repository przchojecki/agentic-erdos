# EP-700 partial resolution

## Statement
For f(n)=min_{1<k<=n/2} gcd(n, C(n,k)), answer three questions on structure and
size for composite n.

## What is resolved
Background provides:
- general bound f(n)<=n/P(n), hence f(n)<=(1+o(1)) n/log n;
- equality f(n)=n/P(n) for n product of two primes (and n=30);
- infinitely many composite n with f(n)>n^{1/2} (e.g. n=p^2).

## What remains open in this note
Full characterization of equality cases and the strongest decay question
f(n) <<_A n/(log n)^A for every A remain open.

## Status
- substantial partial answers to subquestions: known.
- complete characterization/strong universal decay: unresolved.
