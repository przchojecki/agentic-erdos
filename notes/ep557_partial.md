# EP-557 partial resolution

## Statement
For any tree `T` on `n` vertices, is
`R(T;k) <= k n + O(1)`?

## What is resolved
Background says this statement is implied by problem `[548]`.

## What remains open in this note
The record does not itself provide a direct proof here; status depends on the
state of `[548]` (not resolved from this entry alone).

## Status
- reduction/implication to another problem: identified.
- standalone resolution from this record: not extracted.
