# EP-386 partial resolution

## Statement
Can binomial coefficients be products of consecutive primes infinitely often?

## What is resolved
Background includes several explicit examples with `k>=3`, refuting the stronger
informal belief that this might never happen beyond trivial cases.

It also gives known `n` where `C(n,2)` is such a product.

## What remains open in this note
The main infinitude question remains unresolved in the cited material.

## Status
- existence of nontrivial examples: known.
- infinitely-often behavior: unresolved.
