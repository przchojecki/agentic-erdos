# EP-424 partial resolution

## Statement
For the Hofstadter sequence generated by `a_i a_j - 1`, is the set of attained
integers of positive density?

## What is resolved
Background clarifies a stronger historical phrasing ("almost all integers") is
false: by a mod-3 invariant, no integer congruent to `1 (mod 3)` appears, so
density is at most `2/3`.

## What remains open in this note
The weaker current question (positive density) is the intended version and is not
resolved by the cited material.

## Status
- stronger "almost all" version: false.
- positive-density version: unresolved.
