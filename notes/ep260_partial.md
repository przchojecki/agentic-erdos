# EP-260 partial resolution

## Statement
If `a_n` is increasing with `a_n/n -> infinity`, is `sum a_n / 2^{a_n}`
irrational?

## What is resolved
Background gives two stronger hypotheses under which irrationality is proved:
1. `a_{n+1}-a_n -> infinity`.
2. `a_n >> n*sqrt(log n*log log n)`.

## What remains open in this note
The full condition `a_n/n -> infinity` alone is not settled by the cited results.

## Status
- two stronger regimes: resolved.
- full general growth condition: unresolved.
