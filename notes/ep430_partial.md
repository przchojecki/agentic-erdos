# EP-430 partial resolution

## Statement
For the descending sequence `a_i` defined by prime-factor constraints in `[1,n)`,
must some term be composite for all sufficiently large `n`?

## What is resolved
Background records equivalence of this first question with EP-385 (first part).

## What remains open in this note
Only preliminary computational signal is mentioned; no unconditional proof is
cited.

## Status
- equivalence/reformulation with EP-385: known.
- eventual composite-term theorem: unresolved.
