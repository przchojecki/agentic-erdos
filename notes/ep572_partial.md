# EP-572 partial resolution

## Statement
For each `k>=3`, show

`ex(n; C_{2k}) >> n^{1+1/k}`.

## What is resolved
Background states:
- Benson proved the target bound for `k=3` and `k=5`.

So the conjecture is resolved in those two cases.

## Known general progress (still below target)
For arbitrary `k>=3`, background gives

`ex(n; C_{2k}) >> n^{1 + 2/(3k-3+u)}`

(with `u` parity-dependent), which is weaker than exponent `1+1/k`.

## What remains open in this note
The full-for-all-`k>=3` lower bound at exponent `1+1/k` is not resolved by the
provided background.

## Status
- `k=3,5`: resolved.
- general `k>=3`: unresolved.
