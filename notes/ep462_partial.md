# EP-462 statement issue

## Issue
The dataset statement is corrupted (contains an injected fragment like
`", "difficulty": "L1" },{`) and the background field is empty.

## Consequence
No mathematically reliable proof attempt can be made until the intended statement
is restored from a clean source.

## Status
- statement malformed in current dataset entry.
