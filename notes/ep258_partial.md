# EP-258 partial resolution

## Statement
If `a_n` are positive integers with `a_n -> infinity`, is

`sum_n tau(n)/(a_1...a_n)`

irrational?

## What is resolved
Background says Erdos-Straus proved irrationality when `(a_n)` is monotone
nondecreasing.

## What remains open in this note
The unrestricted non-monotone case is not settled by the cited background.

## Status
- monotone `a_n`: resolved.
- general `a_n -> infinity`: unresolved.
