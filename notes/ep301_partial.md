# EP-301 partial resolution

## Statement
Let `f(N)` be the maximum size of `A subseteq {1,...,N}` with no distinct
`a,b1,...,bk in A` satisfying

`1/a = 1/b1 + ... + 1/bk`.

In particular, is `f(N)=(1/2+o(1))N`?

## What is resolved
Background records

`f(N) >= (1/2+o(1))N`

from the interval example, and

`f(N) <= (25/28+o(1))N`

from an elementary disjoint-configuration argument.

## What remains open in this note
The exact asymptotic constant is not determined by these bounds.

## Status
- two-sided density bounds: known.
- exact asymptotic constant: unresolved.
