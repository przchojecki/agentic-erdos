# EP-891 partial resolution

## Statement
For primes `2=p_1<p_2<...` and fixed `k>=2`, must every sufficiently large
interval `[n, n+p_1...p_k)` contain a number with more than `k` prime factors?

## What is resolved
Background records a nearby positive variant (Schinzel via Polya): true when
interval length is `p_1...p_{k-1}p_{k+1}`.

## What remains open in this note
The exact asked length `p_1...p_k` is stated unknown even for `k=2`.
Background also gives only a conditional negative statement for a different
length `p_1...p_k-1` (under Dickson's conjecture).

## Status
- nearby interval-length variant: resolved.
- exact asked interval length: unresolved.
