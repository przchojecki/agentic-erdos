# EP-569 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
For fixed `k>=1`, determine best constant `c_k` such that
`R(C_{2k+1},H) <= c_k m` for all `m`-edge `H` without isolates.

## Attempt route
Tried odd-cycle-vs-sparse-target Ramsey reduction to local expansion bounds and
extremal embeddings.

## Obstacle
Background supplies only problem attribution, without explicit quantitative
partial bounds for `c_k` in this entry.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
