# EP-724 partial resolution

## Statement
If `f(n)` is the maximum number of mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order
`n`, is `f(n) >> n^{1/2}`?

## What is resolved
Background records progressive lower bounds:
`f(n) >> n^{1/91}`, then `n^{1/17}`, then `n^{1/14.8}`.

## What remains open in this note
These do not reach the target exponent `1/2` asked in the problem.

## Status
- positive power-law lower bounds: resolved.
- exponent `1/2` target: unresolved.
