# EP-495 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
Littlewood-type question: is
`liminf_{n->infinity} n ||n alpha|| ||n beta|| = 0`
for all real `alpha,beta`?

## Attempt route
Tried metric/Diophantine approximation reductions via simultaneous rational
approximation windows.

## Obstacle
Background entry contains only the problem label and no directly cited partial
result in this dataset record.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
