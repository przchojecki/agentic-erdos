# EP-568 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
If graph `G` has linear tree Ramsey and quadratic clique Ramsey bounds, must
`R(G,H) << m` for all `H` with `m` edges and no isolates?

## Attempt route
Tried transfer from tree/clique controls to general sparse-target Ramsey size via
decomposition of `H` into bounded-arboricity components.

## Obstacle
Background provides only the question statement (Ramsey-size linearity form),
with no explicit partial theorem in this entry.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
