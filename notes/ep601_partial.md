# EP-601 partial resolution

## Statement
For a limit ordinal `alpha`, if a graph has vertex set `alpha`, must it contain
either an infinite path or an independent set of order type `alpha`?

## What is resolved
Background states two positive ranges:
- In ZFC (Erdos--Hajnal--Milner): true for `alpha < omega_1^{omega+2}`.
- Under Martin's axiom (Larson): true for all `alpha < 2^{aleph_0}`.

So substantial initial ordinal ranges are already settled.

## What remains open in this note
The boundary `alpha = omega_1^{omega+2}` in ZFC is explicitly highlighted as open,
and the full general ZFC classification of limit ordinals is not settled by the
provided background.

## Status
- initial ZFC range: resolved.
- full ZFC classification: unresolved.
