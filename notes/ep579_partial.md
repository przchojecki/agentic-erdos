# EP-579 partial resolution

## Statement
For fixed `delta>0`, do dense `K_{2,2,2}`-free graphs contain linear-size
independent sets?

## What is resolved
Background reports Erd"os-Hajnal-Sos-Szemeredi proved this for `delta > 1/8`.

## What remains open in this note
The statement for arbitrary positive `delta` is not settled by that thresholded
result.

## Status
- `delta>1/8` regime: resolved.
- full `delta>0` regime: unresolved.
