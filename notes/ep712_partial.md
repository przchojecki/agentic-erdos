# EP-712 partial resolution

## Statement
Determine `ex_r(n,K_k^r)/C(n,r)` for fixed `k>r>2`.

## What is resolved
Background records the complete graph case `r=2` via Turan's theorem.

## What remains open in this note
The hypergraph regime `r>2` asked here is not resolved in the provided
background.

## Status
- `r=2` analogue: resolved.
- `r>2` target: unresolved.
