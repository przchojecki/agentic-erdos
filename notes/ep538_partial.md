# EP-538 partial resolution

## Statement
Given multiplicity constraint on representations `m=pa` (`p` prime, `a in A`),
find best upper bound for `sum_{n in A} 1/n`.

## What is resolved
Background gives an unconditional bound
`sum_{n in A} 1/n << r * log N / log log N`
via a double-counting harmonic argument.

## What remains open in this note
Optimal dependence on `r` and `N` (best possible bound) remains open.

## Status
- nontrivial general upper bound: known.
- sharp best-possible bound: unresolved.
