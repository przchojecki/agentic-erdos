# EP-573 partial resolution

## Statement
Ask whether ex(n;{C3,C4}) ~ (n/2)^{3/2}.

## What is resolved
Background records asymptotic (n/2)^{3/2} behavior when forbidding C4 together with
all odd cycles (and related C4,C5 result with O(n) error).

## What remains open in this note
It remains open whether forbidding only C3 and C4 already yields the same asymptotic.

## Status
- stronger-forbidden-family asymptotics known.
- target C3,C4-only asymptotic unresolved.
