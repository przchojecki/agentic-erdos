# EP-696 partial resolution

## Statement
For n, define h(n) as max length of prime chain p_{i+1}≡1 (mod p_i) inside divisors
of n, and H(n) similarly with integer divisors. Estimate h(n), H(n), and ask if
H(n)/h(n)->infinity for almost all n.

## What is resolved
Background records that h(n)->infinity for almost all n (proved in comments), and
states Erdos's belief that normal order of h(n) is log_*(n).

## What remains open in this note
Asymptotics for H(n), sharp normal order for h(n), and almost-all divergence of
H(n)/h(n) are not settled here.

## Status
- qualitative growth h(n)->infinity a.a.s.: known.
- precise h/H asymptotics and ratio question: unresolved.
