# EP-574 partial resolution

## Statement
For `k>=2`, ask whether
`ex(n; {C_{2k-1}, C_{2k}}) = (1+o(1)) (n/2)^{1+1/k}`.

## What is resolved
Background points to a dedicated treatment of the specific case `k=2` in `[573]`.

## What remains open in this note
This entry does not provide a full-for-all-`k` proof, and does not itself state a
complete resolution even for all small `k`.

## Status
- specific-case focused progress: indicated.
- general all-`k` asymptotic formula: unresolved here.
