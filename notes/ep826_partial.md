# EP-826 deep attempt (open)

## Statement
Are there infinitely many n such that for all k>=1, tau(n+k) << k?

## Attempt route
Tried to combine smooth-shift heuristics with divisor-function average bounds on shifts.

## Obstacle
The requirement is uniform in all k and much stronger than average-order control; this
attempt did not produce a construction of infinitely many such n.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
