# EP-1092 partial resolution

## Statement split
For the extremal function `f_r(n)` in the problem definition:
1. Is `f_2(n) >> n`?
2. More generally, is `f_r(n) >>_r n` for all `r`?

## What is resolved
Background states that R"odl's construction (1982) disproves the first question.
So `f_2(n) >> n` is false.

## What remains open in this note
The broader question for general `r` is not resolved by the provided background.

## Status
- First subquestion (`r=2`): resolved (false).
- General `r` subquestion: unresolved here.
