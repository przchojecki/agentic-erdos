# EP-477 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
Does there exist a degree-`>=2` polynomial `f:Z->Z` and set `A subset Z` such
that every integer has a unique representation `n=a+b` with `a in A` and
`b in f(Z)`?

## Attempt route
Tried additive-combinatorial uniqueness constraints and residue-class obstructions
for polynomial image sets.

## Obstacle
Background provides only conjectural belief (negative) and no explicit partial
results to anchor a reduction.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
