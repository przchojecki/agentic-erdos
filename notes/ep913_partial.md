# EP-913 deep attempt (conditional heuristic only)

## Statement
Are there infinitely many n such that in the prime factorization of n(n+1), all
exponents are distinct?

## Attempt route
Analyzed the background heuristic family n=8p^2-1 giving exponent pattern {1,2,3}
if both p and 8p^2-1 are prime.

## Obstacle
This route is conditional on an unproved prime-pattern conjecture, so it does not
currently yield an unconditional proof.

## Status
- conditional mechanism known.
- unconditional infinitude remains open.
