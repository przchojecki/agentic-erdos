# EP-1049 partial resolution

## Statement
For rational `t>1`, is

`sum_{n>=1} 1/(t^n-1) = sum_{n>=1} tau(n)/t^n`

irrational?

## What is resolved
Background says Erdos proved irrationality when `t` is an integer `>=2`.

## What remains open in this note
The full rational-parameter statement (non-integer rational `t>1`) is not solved
by the cited result.

## Status
- integer `t>=2`: resolved.
- general rational `t>1`: unresolved.
