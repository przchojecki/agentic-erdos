# EP-864 partial resolution

## Statement
Maximize |A| subset {1,...,N} when at most one sum n has more than one representation
n=a+b (a<=b in A). Conjectured upper constant: (2/sqrt(3)) N^{1/2}.

## What is resolved
Background gives matching-shape lower bound:
|A| >= (1+o(1)) (2/sqrt(3)) N^{1/2}
via reflected Sidon-set construction.

## What remains open in this note
The corresponding asymptotic upper bound with the same constant is not proved here.

## Status
- sharp-looking lower bound known.
- matching upper bound unresolved.
