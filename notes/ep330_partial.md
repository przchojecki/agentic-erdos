# EP-330 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
Is there a positive-density minimal basis `A` such that each `n in A` is
indispensable for a positive-density set of integers?

## Attempt route
Tried to combine minimal-basis deletion sensitivity with density-increment style
bookkeeping for representation sets.

## Obstacle
Current background entry contains only attribution and no theorem-level partial
bounds to anchor a rigorous reduction.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
