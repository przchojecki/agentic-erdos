# EP-681 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
For large `n`, is there `k` with `n+k` composite and least prime factor
`p(n+k) > k^2`?

## Attempt route
Tried prime-gap and rough-number window heuristics to force composite numbers with
large least prime factors.

## Obstacle
Background gives no explicit partial theorem-level bound for this exact claim.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
