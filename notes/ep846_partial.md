# EP-846 deep attempt (open)

## Statement
If an infinite planar point set A has linear-size subsets with no three collinear, must A
be a finite union of 3-general-position sets?

## Attempt route
Tried decomposition heuristics from local linear general-position extraction to global
finite-partition structure.

## Obstacle
Local largeness of non-collinear subsets does not directly force global finite-cover
structure in this attempt.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
