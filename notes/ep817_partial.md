# EP-817 partial resolution

## Statement
For k>=3, g_k(n) is minimal N such that [1,N] contains n-element A whose subset-sum set
has no nontrivial k-term AP. In particular ask g_3(n)>>3^n.

## What is resolved
Background provides near-target lower bound:
- g_3(n) >> 3^n / n^{O(1)}.

## What remains open in this note
Removing the polynomial loss to prove g_3(n) >> 3^n is not settled here.

## Status
- near-exponential lower bound: known.
- full exponential lower bound without polynomial loss: unresolved.
