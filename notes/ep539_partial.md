# EP-539 partial resolution

## Statement
For `h(n)=min_{|A|=n} |{a/(a,b): a,b in A}|`, estimate growth of `h(n)`.

## What is resolved
Background reports two-sided bounds
`n^{1/2} << h(n) << n^{1-c}`
for some constant `c>0`.

## What remains open in this note
Exact exponent/order of growth is not determined by these bounds.

## Status
- broad growth window: known.
- sharp asymptotics: unresolved.
