# EP-776 partial resolution

## Statement
Given an antichain family with multiplicity-at-least-r per realized set size,
find how large n must be (as function of r) to realize n-3 distinct sizes.

## What is resolved
Background gives key extremal facts:
- for r=1 and n>3, maximum number of realized sizes is n-2;
- for r>1 and n sufficiently large, n-3 is achievable;
- n-2 is never achievable for r>1.

## What remains open in this note
The threshold n(r) guaranteeing realizability of n-3 sizes is not explicit.

## Status
- eventual existence/nonexistence landscape: known.
- quantitative threshold as function of r: unresolved.
