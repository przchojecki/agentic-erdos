# EP-650 partial resolution

## Statement
Estimate f(m) from a divisibility-covering property; asks in particular whether
f(m) << m^{1/2}.

## What is resolved
Background gives lower bound f(m) >> m^{1/2}.

## What remains open in this note
Matching upper bound and sharper asymptotics are unresolved.

## Status
- square-root lower bound known.
- full order-of-growth classification open.
