# EP-866 partial resolution

## Statement
g_k(N): minimal over-threshold for A subset {1,...,2N} ensuring existence of b_1,...,b_k
whose pairwise sums all lie in A. Estimate g_k(N).

## What is resolved
Background records substantial progress:
- g_3(N)=2;
- g_4(N) << 1 (explicit bound g_4(N)<=2032 recorded);
- g_5(N) ~ log N;
- g_6(N) ~ N^{1/2};
- general bounds g_k(N) <<_k N^{1-2^{-k}} and near-linear lower behavior for large k.

## What remains open in this note
A full sharp characterization for all k is not complete.

## Status
- many k-cases and broad asymptotic bounds known.
- full general sharp profile remains open.
