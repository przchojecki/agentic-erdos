# EP-863 partial resolution

## Statement
Compare optimal constants c_r (B_2[r] for sums) and c'_r (difference analogue) in
maximal size ~ constant * N^{1/2}. Ask if c_r != c'_r (and c'_r<c_r) for r>=2.

## What is resolved
Background gives the Sidon base case r=1: c_1=c'_1=1.

## What remains open in this note
The comparison for r>=2 is unresolved by the provided results.

## Status
- r=1 baseline completely known.
- r>=2 constant comparison remains open.
