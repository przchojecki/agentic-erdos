# EP-932 partial resolution

## Statement
Conjecture: for infinitely many r, there are at least two integers n in (p_r,p_{r+1})
whose prime factors are all < p_{r+1}-p_r.

## What is resolved
Background records a one-sided rarity result:
Erdos proved the set of r for which at least one such n exists has density 0.

## What remains open in this note
Density-0 does not preclude infinitely many exceptional r, and the "at least two"
claim remains unproved.

## Status
- strong sparsity result known.
- infinitude with multiplicity >=2 remains open.
