# EP-388 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
Classify or prove finiteness of solutions to equality of two disjoint products of
consecutive integers with block lengths greater than three.

## Attempt route
Tried valuation balancing and Pell-type reductions for fixed block lengths and
fixed separation patterns.

## Obstacle
Background gives only broad conjectural expectation of finiteness, with no cited
partial structural theorem to close significant cases.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
