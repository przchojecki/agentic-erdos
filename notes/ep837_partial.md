# EP-837 partial resolution

## Statement
For density jump parameters in k-uniform hypergraphs, define A_k and ask for A_3.

## What is resolved
Background gives complete 2-uniform classification:
A_2={1-1/k : k>=1}.

## What remains open in this note
The 3-uniform set A_3 is not determined by the provided results.

## Status
- k=2 case classified.
- k=3 classification unresolved.
