# EP-382 partial resolution

## Statement
If the largest prime in `prod_{u<=m<=v} m` has multiplicity at least two, must
`v-u = v^{o(1)}`? Can `v-u` be arbitrarily large?

## What is resolved
Background states Ramachandra's consequences give
`v-u <= v^{1/2+o(1)}`.

It also records that Cramer-style prime-gap conjectures would imply the first
question positively.

## What remains open in this note
Unconditional subpower bound and the second "arbitrarily large" question remain
open in the cited record.

## Status
- `v^{1/2+o(1)}`-scale upper bound: known.
- subpower and arbitrarily-large-gap questions: unresolved.
