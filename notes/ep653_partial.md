# EP-653 partial resolution

## Statement
For points `x_1,...,x_n` in the plane, let `R(x_i)` be number of distinct
nonzero distances from `x_i`. If `g(n)` is the maximum number of distinct values
among `R(x_i)`, is `g(n) >= (1-o(1))n`?

## What is resolved
Background provides two-sided linear-scale bounds:
`g(n) > (7/10)n` (improving earlier `3/8 n`) and
`g(n) < n - c n^{2/3}` for some `c>0`.

## What remains open in this note
Near-full linear behavior `(1-o(1))n` is not settled by the cited bounds.

## Status
- substantial two-sided linear-scale bounds: known.
- asymptotic near-`n` question: unresolved.
