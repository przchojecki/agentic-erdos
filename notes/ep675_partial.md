# EP-675 partial resolution

## Statement
For the translation property (periodic agreement on initial segments), asks about
specific natural sets and growth of minimal shifts.

## What is resolved
Background provides:
- squarefree numbers have the translation property (elementary sieve);
- more general sufficient criterion via Brun sieve for sets built from pairwise
  coprime constraints with `sum_{b<x} 1/b = o(log log x)`.

## What remains open in this note
Open parts include:
- sums of two squares case;
- dense prime-partition model case;
- growth of minimal shifts, and behavior when the harmonic condition is weakened.

## Status
- significant sufficient conditions: known.
- several flagship instances and sharp growth: unresolved.
