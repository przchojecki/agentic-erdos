# EP-873 partial resolution

## Statement
For A={a_i}, F(A,X,k) counts i with lcm(a_i,...,a_{i+k-1})<X. Ask whether for every
epsilon>0 there exists k with F(A,X,k)<X^epsilon.

## What is resolved
Background gives sharp-scale k=3 behavior:
- universal upper bound F(A,X,3) << X^{1/3} log X;
- existence of A with F(A,X,3) >> X^{1/3} log X infinitely often.

## What remains open in this note
The quantifier-changing statement "for every epsilon there exists k" remains open.

## Status
- k=3 behavior well understood.
- general epsilon-k regime unresolved.
