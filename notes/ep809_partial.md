# EP-809 partial resolution

## Statement
For odd-cycle rainbow-coloring constraint in near-Turan graphs, define F_k(n) and ask
whether F_k(n)~n^2/8.

## What is resolved
Background records a quadratic lower bound: F_k(n) >> n^2.

## What remains open in this note
The asymptotic constant (in particular n^2/8) is not determined by current information.

## Status
- correct growth scale (quadratic) has a lower bound.
- sharp asymptotic constant remains unresolved.
