# EP-575 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
For finite forbidden family `F` containing a bipartite graph, must there exist a
bipartite `G in F` with `ex(n;G) <<_F ex(n;F)`?

## Attempt route
Tried extremal-family reduction via selecting candidate bipartite minimizers and
comparing Zarankiewicz-type exponents.

## Obstacle
Background gives only statement attribution and no partial theorem-level result in
this entry.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
