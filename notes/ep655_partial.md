# EP-655 statement issue (counterexample in background)

## Statement
With the given circle-incidence restriction, asks whether there are at least
`(1+c)n/2` distinct distances for some constant `c>0` and large `n`.

## Issue
Background gives an explicit counterexample: `n` equally spaced points on a
circle disprove the conjecture as written.

## Consequence
The statement is false as currently phrased; background suggests an omitted
general-position assumption was likely intended.

## Status
- false as written (counterexample in background).
