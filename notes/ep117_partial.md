# EP-117 partial resolution

## Statement
Let `h(n)` be the minimum number of Abelian subgroups needed to cover any group
where every subset of size `>n` contains two commuting distinct elements.
Estimate `h(n)`.

## What is resolved
Background cites Pyber (and earlier lower-bound work) proving constants
`c2>c1>1` with

`c1^n < h(n) < c2^n`.

Hence the growth type is known to be exponential in `n`.

## What remains open in this note
The exact asymptotic rate (for example, sharp exponential base or finer formula)
is not determined by the provided references.

## Status
- exponential-scale growth: resolved.
- sharp asymptotics/constants: unresolved.
