# EP-725 partial resolution

## Statement
Give an asymptotic formula for the number of k x n Latin rectangles.

## What is resolved
Background gives asymptotic
count ~ exp(-C(k,2)) (n!)^k
for k=o((log n)^{3/2-epsilon}), extended to k<=n^{1/3-o(1)}.

## What remains open in this note
Full asymptotic regimes beyond the known k-range remain open.

## Status
- broad asymptotic range proven.
- complete k-range asymptotics unresolved.
