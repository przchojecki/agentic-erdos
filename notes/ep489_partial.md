# EP-489 partial resolution

## Statement
For sparse divisor sets `A` with `|A cap [1,x]|=o(x^{1/2})`, define
`B={n>=1 : a divides n for all a in A}` and ask about existence/finiteness of
`lim (1/x) sum_{b_i<x} (b_{i+1}-b_i)^2`.

## What is resolved
Background provides a concrete solved case: when `A={p^2 : p prime}` (so `B` is
squarefree numbers), Erdos proved existence of the limit.

## What remains open in this note
The full general statement for arbitrary such sparse sets `A` is unresolved in
the cited record.

## Status
- squarefree model case: resolved.
- general sparse-set case: unresolved.
