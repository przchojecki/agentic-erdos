# EP-279 partial resolution

## Statement
For fixed `k>=3`, choose residue classes `a_p mod p` for all primes `p` so that
all sufficiently large integers lie in some progression `a_p + t p` with `t>=k`.

## What is resolved
Background states that analogous covering behavior is known for `k=1` and `k=2`
under a divergent harmonic-sum condition on the underlying set.

## What remains open in this note
The target regime `k>=3` is explicitly described as difficult in the cited text.

## Status
- `k=1,2` analogue: known.
- `k>=3` target: unresolved.
