# EP-312 partial resolution

## Statement
For large reciprocal-sum multisets `A`, does one always find a submultiset `S`
with

`1 - exp(-cK) < sum_{n in S} 1/n <= 1`?

## What is resolved
Background says Erd"os-Graham proved a weaker quantitative form with
`exp(-cK)` replaced by a term of order `1/K^2`.

## What remains open in this note
The stronger exponential-accuracy gap in the statement is not proved in the
provided background.

## Status
- polynomial-size gap near 1: known.
- exponential-size gap near 1: unresolved.
