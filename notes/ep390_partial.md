# EP-390 partial resolution

## Statement
Let `f(n)` be minimal `m` such that

`n! = a_1 ... a_k` with `n < a_1 < ... < a_k = m`.

Question: is there `c>0` with

`f(n)-2n ~ c * n/log n`?

## What is resolved
Background gives (Erdos--Guy--Selfridge, 1982):

`f(n)-2n asymp n/log n`.

So the scale/order of magnitude is known.

## What remains open in this note
The existence/value of the exact asymptotic constant `c` is not settled by the
provided background.

## Status
- Order of growth: resolved.
- Exact asymptotic constant: unresolved.
