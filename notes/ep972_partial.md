# EP-972 deep attempt (open)

## Statement
For irrational alpha>1, are there infinitely many primes p such that floor(alpha p)
is also prime?

## Attempt route
Used distribution of fractional parts along primes as heuristic support and compared
with known Beatty-prime results.

## Obstacle
Background gives infinitely many primes of form floor(alpha n), but this does not
resolve the two-prime coupling p and floor(alpha p).

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
