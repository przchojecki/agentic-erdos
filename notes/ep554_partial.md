# EP-554 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
Show that for odd cycles,
`R(C_{2n+1};k)/R(K_3;k) -> 0` as `k->infinity`.

## Attempt route
Tried multicolor odd-cycle Ramsey comparison via known triangle-Ramsey growth
scales and sparse-regularity heuristics.

## Obstacle
Background states the problem is open even for `n=2`, and gives no theorem-level
partial result in this record.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
