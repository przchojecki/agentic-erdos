# EP-949 partial resolution

## Statement
If `S subset R` has no solutions to `a+b=c`, must there exist continuum-sized
`A subseteq R\S` with `A+A subseteq R\S`?

## What is resolved
Background gives a positive result for the Sidon-restricted variant:
if `S` is Sidon, then such a continuum-sized set `A` exists.

## What remains open in this note
The full statement for arbitrary sum-free `S` is not settled by the provided
background.

## Status
- Sidon `S` variant: resolved.
- general sum-free `S`: unresolved.
