# EP-126 partial resolution

## Statement
f(n): minimum guaranteed number of distinct prime factors of product_{a!=b in A}(a+b)
for |A|=n. Ask whether f(n)/log n->infinity.

## What is resolved
Classical bounds from background:
log n << f(n) << n/log n.

## What remains open in this note
Growth beyond a constant multiple of log n is not proved in general, and sub-maximal
upper refinements were noted as unproved.

## Status
- broad two-sided bounds known.
- target divergence f(n)/log n->infinity unresolved.
