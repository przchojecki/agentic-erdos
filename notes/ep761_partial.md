# EP-761 deep attempt (open)

## Statement
Ask whether large chromatic number forces large dichromatic number, and whether
large cochromatic number contains a subgraph with large dichromatic number.

## Attempt route
Tried implication chain through orientation-sensitive coloring constraints and the
known reduction noted in the background.

## Obstacle
The reduction shows second question would imply first, but no mechanism here forces
dichromatic growth from high chromatic/cochromatic complexity.

## Status
- implication relation between questions known.
- both core existence implications unresolved in this attempt.
