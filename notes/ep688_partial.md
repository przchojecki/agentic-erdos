# EP-688 partial resolution

## Statement
For covering `[1,n]` by chosen residue classes modulo primes in
`(n^{epsilon_n}, n]`, estimate `epsilon_n`; in particular, is `epsilon_n=o(1)`?

## What is resolved
Background records a nontrivial lower bound:
`epsilon_n >> (log log log n)/(log log n)`.

## What remains open in this note
Asymptotic decay (especially whether `epsilon_n->0`) is not resolved by this lower
bound.

## Status
- explicit lower bound: known.
- asymptotic behavior / o(1) question: unresolved.
