# EP-317 partial resolution

## Statement split
1. Existence of very small nonzero signed harmonic sums with magnitude
   `O(2^{-n})`.
2. Strict lower-bound version of the lcm barrier for nonzero sums.

## What is resolved
Background records a weak positive form of (1) with upper bound
`2^{-n * (logloglog n)^{1+o(1)} / log n}`.

For (2), the non-strict lcm lower bound is immediate, and strict inequality is
known to fail for small `n`.

## What remains open in this note
Sharp order for (1) and eventual strict inequality behavior for (2) remain open
in the record.

## Status
- weak form and baseline barriers: known.
- sharp asymptotics and strict large-`n` behavior: unresolved.
