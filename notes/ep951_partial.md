# EP-951 deep attempt (open)

## Statement
For a multiplicatively separated sequence of reals a_i (distance at least 1 between
distinct generalized products), ask whether count{a_i<=x}<=pi(x).

## Attempt route
Compared the spacing condition with Beurling-prime heuristics and uniqueness of
factorization-type constraints.

## Obstacle
Background gives related Beurling conjectural context but no direct theorem proving
this pi(x)-upper-bound statement.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
