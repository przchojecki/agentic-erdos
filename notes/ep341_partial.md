# EP-341 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
Starting from a finite seed set and greedily extending by forbidding pairwise sums,
is the difference sequence eventually periodic?

## Attempt route
Tried automaton-style state compression on recent differences and sumset frontier,
with small-seed simulation checks.

## Obstacle
Background gives only qualitative evidence that transient behavior can be very
long; no theorem-level structural criterion is cited.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
