# EP-313 partial resolution

## Statement
Are there infinitely many solutions

`1/p1 + ... + 1/pk = 1 - 1/m`

with distinct primes `p1<...<pk` and integer `m>=2`?

## What is resolved
Background identifies these `m` as primary pseudoperfect numbers and reports a
finite known list (eight known values).

A local exhaustive check in this workspace up to `m<=10^7` found exactly
`m in {2,6,42,1806,47058}`.

## What remains open in this note
Infinitude is not proved or disproved by the cited material.

## Status
- finite verified examples and arithmetic characterization: known.
- infinitude question: unresolved.
