# EP-971 partial resolution

## Statement
For least prime p(a,d) in residue class a mod d, ask whether for all large d there is
c>0 such that p(a,d)>(1+c)phi(d)log d for many residues a (positive proportion).

## What is resolved
Background records:
- this holds for an infinite sequence of d;
- for any epsilon>0, many residues also satisfy p(a,d)<epsilon phi(d)log d.

## What remains open in this note
Uniform-for-all-large-d positive-proportion lower overshoot remains open.

## Status
- strong partial distribution results known.
- full uniform statement unresolved.
