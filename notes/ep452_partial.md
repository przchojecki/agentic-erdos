# EP-452 partial resolution

## Statement
Find the largest interval I subset [x,2x] on which omega(n)>log log n for all n in I.

## What is resolved
Background provides:
- density of such n is 1/2;
- CRT construction yields interval length at least
  (1+o(1)) log x/(log log x)^2.

## What remains open in this note
True maximal interval size and possible much longer polylog scales remain open.

## Status
- nontrivial lower bound construction known.
- sharp extremal interval length unresolved.
