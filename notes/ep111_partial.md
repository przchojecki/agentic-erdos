# EP-111 partial resolution

## Statement
For `G` with chromatic number `aleph_1`, must `h_G(n)/n -> infinity`, where
`h_G(n)` is the deletion cost to make every `n`-vertex subgraph bipartite?

## What is resolved
Background provides two-sided growth information:
- universal lower bound `h_G(n) >> n` for every such `G`;
- existence of a graph with `h_G(n) << n^{3/2}`.

## What remains open in this note
Whether `h_G(n)/n -> infinity` always holds is not settled by the cited results.

## Status
- baseline lower and upper envelopes (`n` to `n^{3/2}`): known.
- exact asymptotic growth law: unresolved.
