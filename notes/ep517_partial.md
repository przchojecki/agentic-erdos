# EP-517 partial resolution

## Statement
For lacunary entire series f(z)=sum a_k z^{n_k}, ask whether n_k/k->infinity forces
f to take every value infinitely often.

## What is resolved
Background gives strong partial theorems:
- if sum 1/n_k < infinity, every value is taken infinitely often (Biernacki);
- under finite-order assumptions and gap growth, similar infinite-value conclusions
  (Polya).

## What remains open in this note
The full n_k/k->infinity criterion without extra assumptions remains unresolved.

## Status
- substantial sufficient conditions known.
- full conjectured criterion open.
