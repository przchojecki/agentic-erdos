# EP-950 partial resolution

## Statement
For f(n)=sum_{p<n}1/(n-p), ask about liminf, limsup, and growth bounds.

## What is resolved
Background provides substantial information:
- average and second moment: sum_{n<x} f(n) ~ x and sum_{n<x} f(n)^2 ~ x;
- certain short-interval prime lower bounds imply liminf f(n)>0;
- additional strong prime-distribution hypotheses would imply f(n)<<log log log n.

## What remains open in this note
Conjectured liminf=1, limsup=infinity, and universal f(n)=o(log log n) are not proved.

## Status
- robust moment-level partial results known.
- pointwise liminf/limsup and sharp growth questions unresolved.
