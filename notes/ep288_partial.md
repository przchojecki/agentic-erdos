# EP-288 partial resolution

## Statement
Are there only finitely many interval pairs `(I1,I2)` with

`sum_{n in I1} 1/n + sum_{n in I2} 1/n` an integer?

## What is resolved
Background gives explicit examples where such an integer value occurs.

## What remains open in this note
The finiteness question is open even in the restricted case `|I2|=1`.

## Status
- nontrivial examples: known.
- finiteness (even restricted case): unresolved.
