# EP-963 partial resolution

## Statement
f(n): guaranteed size of a dissociated subset in any n-element set of reals. Ask in
particular if f(n)>=floor(log_2 n).

## What is resolved
Background records greedy lower bound:
f(n)>=floor(log_3 n).

## What remains open in this note
Closing the base-3 to base-2 gap is unresolved.

## Status
- logarithmic lower bound known.
- stronger log_2 threshold remains open.
