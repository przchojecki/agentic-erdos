# EP-954 partial resolution

## Statement
For Rosen's recursively defined sequence, let R(x)=# {(i,j): i<=j, a_i+a_j<=x }.
Ask whether R(x)=x+O(x^{1/4+o(1)}).

## What is resolved
Background gives the built-in lower control R(x)>=x by construction.

## What remains open in this note
Even the upper asymptotic R(x)<=(1+o(1))x was not proved in the cited background,
so the stronger O(x^{1/4+o(1)}) error term is far open.

## Status
- baseline lower bound known.
- target asymptotic upper/error bound unresolved.
