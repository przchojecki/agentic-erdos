# EP-960 partial resolution

## Statement
Threshold f_{r,k}(n): enough ordinary lines in an n-point set (no k collinear)
forces an r-point subset whose all pair-lines are ordinary. Ask if f_{r,k}(n)=o(n^2)
or even O(n).

## What is resolved
Background gives Turan-type quadratic upper bound:
f_{r,k}(n) <= (1-1/(r-1)) n^2/2 + 1.

## What remains open in this note
Subquadratic (or linear) threshold remains open from current information.

## Status
- explicit quadratic upper bound known.
- subquadratic/linear regime unresolved.
