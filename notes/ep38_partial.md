# EP-38 partial resolution

## Statement
Ask for a set B that is not an additive basis but still guarantees a uniform positive
Schnirelmann-density increment for A union (A+b), with b chosen from B.

## What is resolved
Background gives density increment when B is an additive basis of finite order k.
It also notes existence of essential components that are not additive bases.

## What remains open in this note
Whether such non-basis B can satisfy the stronger uniform increment property remains
unresolved.

## Status
- additive-basis case known; related non-basis constructions exist.
- stated non-basis strengthening remains open.
