# EP-670 partial resolution

## Statement
If `A subseteq R^d` has `n` points with all pairwise distances differing by at
least `1`, must `diam(A) >= (1+o(1)) n^2`?

## What is resolved
Background states Erdos proved this claim for `d=1`.

So the one-dimensional case is settled positively.

## What remains open in this note
The problem is posed for general `d`; no proof for all dimensions is supplied in
the provided background.

## Status
- `d=1`: resolved.
- general `d`: unresolved.
