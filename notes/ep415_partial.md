# EP-415 partial resolution

## Statement
For ordering patterns of consecutive values of phi(m+1),...,phi(m+k), define F(n)
and ask for precise constant-asymptotic and pattern extremality questions.

## What is resolved
Background states Erdos proved F(n)~ order log log log n (two-sided asymptotic scale).

## What remains open in this note
Exact constant c and the additional pattern-ranking questions are not settled by
that order result.

## Status
- correct growth order known.
- finer constant/pattern-structure questions unresolved.
