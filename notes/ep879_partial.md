# EP-879 partial resolution

## Statement
For admissible pairwise-coprime S subset {1,...,n}, maximize sum of elements G(n) and
compare to H(n). Also ask whether maximizing sets must contain numbers with many prime
factors.

## What is resolved
Background gives strong bounds:
H(n)-n^{3/2-o(1)} < G(n) < H(n),
and (H(n)-G(n))/n -> infinity.
It also records: conditional proof of G(n)>H(n)-n^{1+o(1)} under strong prime assumptions,
and proof of the second claim for k=2.

## What remains open in this note
Unconditional near-linear error term and full k>=2 multiplicative-structure statement
remain unresolved.

## Status
- substantial unconditional bounds plus partial structural result known.
- strongest forms remain open.
