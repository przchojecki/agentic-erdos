# EP-323 partial resolution

## Statement split
1. Is `f_{k,k}(x) >>_epsilon x^{1-epsilon}` for every `epsilon>0`?
2. For `m<k`, is `f_{k,m}(x) >> x^{m/k}` for all large `x`?

## What is resolved
Background records a full solution of the `k=2` diagonal case:

`f_{2,2}(x) ~ c x / sqrt(log x)`

(Landau, with `c>0`).

So for `k=2` the diagonal quantity is understood asymptotically.

## What remains open in this note
For `k>2`, background says even the coarse question `f_{k,k}(x)=o(x)` is not known.
Thus the stated lower-bound targets are unresolved in general. The `m<k` question is
also open in general in the provided record.

## Status
- `k=2` diagonal case: resolved.
- general `k>2` / `m<k` claims: unresolved.
