# EP-992 partial resolution

## Statement
For any integer sequence x_n, ask if for almost all alpha discrepancy satisfies
D(N)<<N^{1/2}(log N)^{o(1)} or stronger loglog-poly factor.

## What is resolved
Background records general almost-sure bounds improved over time:
N^{1/2}(log N)^{5/2+o(1)} to N^{1/2}(log N)^{3/2+o(1)}.
For lacunary sequences, much stronger loglog-scale control is known.

## What remains open in this note
General-sequence bound at the near-square-root log^{o(1)} scale is unresolved.

## Status
- substantial metrical discrepancy bounds known.
- strongest universal logarithmic refinement open.
