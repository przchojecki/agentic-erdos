# EP-870 partial resolution

## Statement
For additive bases of order `k>=3`, does a logarithmic lower bound on
representation counts force existence of a minimal basis of order `k`?

## What is resolved
Background gives a `k=2` theorem (Erdos--Nathanson) with explicit threshold:
if `1_A*1_A(n) > (log(4/3))^{-1} log n` for large `n`, then a minimal basis
exists.

## What remains open in this note
The stated problem for all `k>=3` is not resolved by the cited result.

## Status
- `k=2`: resolved with explicit logarithmic threshold.
- `k>=3`: unresolved.
