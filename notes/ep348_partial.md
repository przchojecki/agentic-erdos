# EP-348 partial resolution

## Statement
For which `0<=m<n` does there exist a complete sequence `A` that remains complete
after deleting any `m` terms but fails completeness after deleting any `n` terms?

## What is resolved
Background gives concrete realizable pairs:
- `(m,n)=(0,1)` via powers of two.
- `(m,n)=(1,2)` via Fibonacci-type example.

Background also records a negative theorem for a stronger completeness notion:
for that stronger notion, no such sequence exists when `2<=m<n`.

## What remains open in this note
Under the intended weaker completeness notion (allowing finitely many exceptions),
cases such as `(m,n)=(2,3)` remain open.

## Status
- some parameter pairs and strong-sense obstruction: known.
- full weak-sense classification: unresolved.
