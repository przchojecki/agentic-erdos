# EP-979 partial resolution

## Statement
For `k>=2`, let `f_k(n)` count representations

`n = p_1^k + ... + p_k^k`

with primes `p_i`. Is `limsup f_k(n)=infinity`?

## What is resolved
Background states Erdos proved this for `k=2` and also for `k=3`
(the `k=3` proof noted as unpublished in the record).

## What remains open in this note
No general proof for all `k>=2` is provided in the cited background.

## Status
- `k=2,3`: resolved in background record.
- all `k`: unresolved here.
