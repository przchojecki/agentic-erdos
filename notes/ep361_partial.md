# EP-361 statement issue

## Issue
The dataset statement appears corrupted (it includes an injected fragment like
`", "difficulty": "L1" },{`) and the background field is empty.

## Consequence
No rigorous proof attempt can be anchored without reconstructing the intended
problem text from a clean source.

## Status
- statement malformed in current dataset entry.
