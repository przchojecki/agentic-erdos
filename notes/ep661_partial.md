# EP-661 partial resolution

## Statement
In `R^2`, can one find `x_1,...,x_n,y_1,...,y_n` with
`#{d(x_i,y_j)} = o(n/sqrt(log n))`?

## What is resolved
Background gives a higher-dimensional contrast:
in `R^4` there are constructions with a single distance (`d(x_i,y_j)=1` for all
`i,j`).

## What remains open in this note
The planar (`R^2`) target remains unresolved in the cited entry.

## Status
- higher-dimensional benchmark (`R^4`) known.
- planar asymptotic question: unresolved.
