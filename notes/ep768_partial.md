# EP-768 partial resolution

## Statement
For set A of integers n with a divisor-congruence condition at every prime p|n,
ask whether density has form exp(-(c+o(1)) sqrt(log N) log log N).

## What is resolved
Background gives two-sided bounds:
- lower: exp(-c sqrt(log N) log log N),
- upper: exp(-(1+o(1)) sqrt(log N log log N)).

## What remains open in this note
These bounds do not match in scale, so the precise exponential asymptotic constant
and exponent shape remain unproved.

## Status
- nontrivial two-sided density bounds known.
- sharp asymptotic formula unresolved.
