# EP-563 partial resolution

## Statement
For `0<=alpha<1/2`, prove
`F(n,alpha) ~ c_alpha log n`.

## What is resolved
Background gives matching two-sided order of growth:
`F(n,alpha) asymp_alpha log n`.

## What remains open in this note
The precise asymptotic constant `c_alpha` is not identified by the cited bounds.

## Status
- logarithmic order of growth: known.
- exact leading constant: unresolved.
