# EP-593 partial resolution

## Statement
Characterize finite 3-uniform hypergraphs that occur in every 3-uniform
hypergraph of chromatic number `>aleph_0`.

## What is resolved
Background says the analogous graph (`2`-uniform) problem is completely solved:
for chromatic number `>=aleph_1`, all finite bipartite graphs must appear, while
no fixed odd cycle is forced.

## What remains open in this note
The 3-uniform characterization asked here is not resolved by the cited data.

## Status
- graph analogue: resolved.
- 3-uniform characterization: unresolved.
