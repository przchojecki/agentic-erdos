# EP-638 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
Given a finite-family Ramsey property for all finite color counts, must there be
an infinite-cardinal analogue via a graph whose finite subgraphs lie in the
family?

## Attempt route
Tried compactness/ultrafilter style lifting from finite-color forcing to infinite
colorings.

## Obstacle
Background gives only a speculative question and no cited partial theorem.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
