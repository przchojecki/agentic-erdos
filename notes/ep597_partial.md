# EP-597 partial resolution

## Statement
For `K4`- and `K_{aleph0,aleph0}`-free `G` on at most `aleph1` vertices, ask
whether `omega_1^2 -> (omega_1 omega, G)^2`.

## What is resolved
Background gives:
- positive theorem `omega_1^2 -> (omega_1 omega, 3)^2`;
- a negative result showing the older weaker formulation (assuming only `K4`-free)
  is false via `K_{aleph0,aleph0}`.

## What remains open in this note
The full target statement for general such `G` (including finite `G`) is not
resolved by cited results.

## Status
- key special case and correction of older formulation: known.
- full general statement: unresolved.
