# EP-847 deep attempt (open)

## Statement
If every n-point subset of an infinite A subset N has an epsilon n-sized 3-AP-free
subset, must A be a finite union of 3-AP-free sets?

## Attempt route
Tried to lift local linear-size AP-free extraction to a global finite-color decomposition.

## Obstacle
No mechanism was found to convert local extraction guarantees into a finite global
partition into 3-AP-free pieces.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
