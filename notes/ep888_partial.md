# EP-888 partial resolution

## Statement
Maximize A subset {1,...,n} such that for a<=b<=c<=d in A with abcd a square, one must
have ad=bc.

## What is resolved
Background/comments record:
- upper bound |A|=o(n);
- lower bound from primes: |A|>>n/log n;
- improved lower bound from semiprimes: (1+o(1)) n log log n / log n.

## What remains open in this note
The true order of magnitude (and matching upper/lower asymptotics) is unresolved.

## Status
- meaningful two-sided progress known.
- sharp asymptotic size remains open.
