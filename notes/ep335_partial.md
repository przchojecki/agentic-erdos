# EP-335 partial resolution

## Statement
Characterize positive-density sets `A,B` with

`d(A+B)=d(A)+d(B)`.

## What is resolved
Background gives a concrete construction family using rotations on
`R/Z` (and corresponding measurable sets) where equality holds.

## What remains open in this note
A complete characterization is not supplied; the text explicitly asks whether all
such examples come from analogous group constructions.

## Status
- broad explicit model family: known.
- full characterization: unresolved.
