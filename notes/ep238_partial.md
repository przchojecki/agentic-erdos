# EP-238 partial resolution

## Statement
Given `c1,c2>0`, must every sufficiently large `x` have more than `c1 log x`
consecutive primes `<=x` whose pairwise gaps are all `>c2`?

## What is resolved
Background records Erdos proved this for any fixed `c2>0` when `c1` is chosen
sufficiently small.

## What remains open in this note
The uniform claim for arbitrary prescribed positive `c1,c2` is not settled by
the provided background.

## Status
- small-`c1` regime (for fixed `c2`): resolved.
- full parameter range: unresolved.
