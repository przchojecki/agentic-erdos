# EP-684 partial resolution

## Statement
For the decomposition of `binom(n,k)` into small-prime and large-prime parts,
define `f(n)` as first `k` where the small-prime part exceeds `n^2`. Bound `f(n)`.

## What is resolved
Background says Mahler's theorem implies `f(n)->infinity`.

## What remains open in this note
Mahler's result is ineffective here and does not yield explicit growth bounds for
`f(n)`.

## Status
- qualitative divergence `f(n)->infinity`: known.
- quantitative growth bounds: unresolved.
