# EP-694 partial resolution

## Statement
For totient fibers, with f_max(n) and f_min(n) the largest/smallest m such that
phi(m)=n, study max_{n<=x} f_max(n)/f_min(n).

## What is resolved
Background links this to Carmichael's problem (existence of n with unique
preimage, i.e. ratio 1), and records Erdos's implication: if one such n exists,
then infinitely many exist.

## What remains open in this note
No asymptotic estimate for max_{n<=x} f_max(n)/f_min(n) is obtained here.

## Status
- uniqueness-case structural implication: known.
- growth of the maximal ratio: unresolved.
