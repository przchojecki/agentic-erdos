# EP-770 partial resolution

## Statement
Define h(n) as the minimal H such that 2^n-1,3^n-1,...,H^n-1 are mutually coprime.
Questions ask about densities of h(n)=p, liminf h(n), and a large-prime divisor criterion.

## What is resolved
Background records:
- h(n)=n+1 iff n+1 is prime.
- h(n) is unbounded on odd n.

## What remains open in this note
Existence of each density delta_p, behavior of liminf h(n), and the stated largest-prime
criterion are not resolved here.

## Status
- structural special cases and unboundedness on odd n: known.
- main distribution/asymptotic questions: unresolved.
