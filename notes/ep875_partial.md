# EP-875 deep attempt (open)

## Statement
For infinite A with disjoint r-fold sum sets S_r, determine minimal growth and possible
smallness of gaps a_{n+1}-a_n.

## Attempt route
Tried sparse additive-structure constructions balancing disjointness of all S_r against
slow growth.

## Obstacle
Maintaining disjointness simultaneously across all r imposes strong global constraints;
this attempt did not yield near-optimal growth bounds.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
