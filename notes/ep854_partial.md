# EP-854 partial resolution

## Statement
For reduced residues modulo the primorial n_k, study which even gap sizes occur as
successive differences a_{i+1}-a_i, including first missing even size and multiplicity.

## What is resolved
Background reports explicit computation (Lacampagne-Selfridge) indicating Erdos's
initial all-even-up-to-max-gap expectation fails already at n_k=2*3*5*7*11*13.

## What remains open in this note
No general asymptotic estimate is provided for the first missing even size or for the
count of represented even sizes relative to the maximal gap.

## Status
- finite computational counterexample signal to initial guess: known.
- general quantitative theory remains open.
