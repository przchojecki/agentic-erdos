# EP-938 deep attempt (open)

## Statement
If n_k are powerful numbers in increasing order, are there only finitely many
3-term arithmetic progressions of consecutive terms n_k,n_{k+1},n_{k+2}?

## Attempt route
Tried spacing and local-density heuristics for powerful numbers to constrain
consecutive-term arithmetic patterns.

## Obstacle
No theorem-level partial result in the entry directly controls consecutive-index APs.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
