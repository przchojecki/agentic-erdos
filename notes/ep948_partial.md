# EP-948 partial resolution

## Statement
Seek k and growth control a_n<f(n) infinitely often such that finite-sums set of
(a_n) misses at least one color in every k-coloring variant.

## What is resolved
Background gives a negative result for a stronger version:
Galvin constructed a 2-coloring showing one cannot always force monochromatic
finite-sums behavior in the originally stronger formulation.

## What remains open in this note
The weaker current version remains open (even for countably many colors per background).

## Status
- stronger monochromatic target is false.
- stated weaker variant remains open.
