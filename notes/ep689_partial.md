# EP-689 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
Can one choose residue classes modulo all primes `<=n` so each integer in
`[1,n]` is covered at least twice?

## Attempt route
Tried probabilistic multi-cover and greedy covering heuristics for congruence
systems.

## Obstacle
Background gives only the problem and related variants; no theorem-level partial
result is cited for the double-cover case.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
