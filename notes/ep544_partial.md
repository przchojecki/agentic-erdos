# EP-544 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
Show `R(3,k+1)-R(3,k)->infinity` and ask whether
`R(3,k+1)-R(3,k)=o(k)`.

## Attempt route
Tried to combine known triangle-Ramsey growth heuristics with increment
comparisons from adjacent `k` values.

## Obstacle
Background entry gives only problem attribution and no explicit partial theorem in
this dataset record.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
