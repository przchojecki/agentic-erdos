# EP-326 partial resolution

## Statement
If `A subset N` is an additive basis of order 2, must there be a subbasis
`B subseteq A` such that `lim b_k/k^2` does not exist?

## What is resolved
Background notes the stronger original form with `A=B` was disproved by Cassels.

## What remains open in this note
The weakened subbasis version in the current statement is not resolved by the
provided background.

## Status
- stronger `A=B` version: false.
- current subbasis version: unresolved.
