# EP-602 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
For countably-infinite sets `(A_i)` with pairwise finite intersections not equal
to `1`, does there exist a 2-coloring of `union A_i` with no monochromatic `A_i`
(Property B)?

## Attempt route
Tried random-coloring plus local-lemma style control using intersection-size
constraints.

## Obstacle
Background gives the posed problem only; no theorem-level partial result is cited
for this exact formulation.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
