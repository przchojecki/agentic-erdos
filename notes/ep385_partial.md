# EP-385 partial resolution

## Statement
For `F(n)=max_{m<n, m composite}(m+p(m))`, is `F(n)>n` eventually? Does
`F(n)-n -> infinity`?

## What is resolved
Background records an equivalence of the first question with EP-430.

## What remains open in this note
No unconditional proof is cited for eventual positivity or divergence.

## Status
- structural reformulation/equivalence: known.
- both asymptotic questions: unresolved.
