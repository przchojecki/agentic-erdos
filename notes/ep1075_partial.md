# EP-1075 partial resolution

## Statement
For `r>=3`, does edge count `>(1+eps)(n/r)^r` force a growing-size subgraph with
density constant `c_r>r^{-r}`?

## What is resolved
Background gives Erdos' theorem with constant `c_r=r^{-r}` under a denser global
hypothesis (at least `eps n^r` edges).

## What remains open in this note
The sharpened target in the statement asks both a lower edge threshold around
`(n/r)^r` and improved constant `>r^{-r}`, which are not delivered by the cited
result.

## Status
- denser-regime `c_r=r^{-r}` statement: resolved.
- sharpened sparse-threshold / better-constant form: unresolved.
