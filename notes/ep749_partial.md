# EP-749 deep attempt (open)

## Statement
For each epsilon>0, ask whether there exists A subset N with lower density of A+A
at least 1-epsilon while representation counts 1_A*1_A(n) remain uniformly bounded.

## Attempt route
Tested sparse-basis style constructions (Sidon-like and random-perturbed) to keep
bounded multiplicities while making A+A almost full in density.

## Obstacle
Known bounded-representation constructions are too sparse to force lower density
1-epsilon of A+A, while denser constructions quickly raise representation counts.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
