# EP-524 partial resolution

## Statement
For random-sign binary-digit polynomials, determine typical order of
M_n(t)=max_{x in [-1,1]} |sum_{k<=n} (-1)^{eps_k(t)} x^k|.

## What is resolved
Background gives opposite-direction partial bounds for almost all t:
- infinitely many n with M_n(t) << sqrt(n/loglog n),
- and growth beyond n^{1/2-epsilon} eventually (in limsup sense).

## What remains open in this note
Exact almost-sure order of magnitude is unresolved.

## Status
- nontrivial upper/lower fluctuation bounds known.
- sharp typical scale open.
