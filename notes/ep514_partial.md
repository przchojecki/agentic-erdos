# EP-514 partial resolution

## Statement
For an entire transcendental `f`, does there exist a path `L` along which
`|f(z)/z^n| -> infinity` for every fixed `n`, and can growth along such paths be
quantified versus `M(r)`?

## What is resolved
Background states Boas (unpublished) proved existence of such a path for the
first part.

## What remains open in this note
Quantitative path-length and sharper growth-rate questions are not settled by the
cited statement.

## Status
- path existence (first part): resolved.
- quantitative refinements: unresolved.
