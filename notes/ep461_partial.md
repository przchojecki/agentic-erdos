# EP-461 partial resolution

## Statement
For `f(n,t)` counting distinct `t`-smooth components in `[n+1,n+t]`, is
`f(n,t) >> t` uniformly?

## What is resolved
Background reports the lower bound `f(n,t) >> t/log t`.

## What remains open in this note
The full linear-in-`t` lower bound remains open in the cited material.

## Status
- `t/log t` lower bound: known.
- uniform linear lower bound: unresolved.
