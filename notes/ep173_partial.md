# EP-173 partial resolution

## Statement
In any 2-coloring of `R^2`, for all but at most one triangle `T`, must there be
a monochromatic congruent copy of `T`?

## What is resolved
Background reports Shader proved the statement for a single right triangle.

## What remains open in this note
The full "all but at most one triangle" claim is not established by the cited
result.

## Status
- right-triangle case: resolved.
- full near-universal triangle claim: unresolved.
