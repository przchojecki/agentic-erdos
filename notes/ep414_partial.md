# EP-414 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
For iterates of `h(n)=n+tau(n)`, do all starting values eventually merge into a
single trajectory class?

## Attempt route
Tried monotonicity and growth-gap comparisons between two trajectories together
with collision forcing via divisor-count fluctuations.

## Obstacle
Background provides only attribution and belief, without theorem-level partial
bounds to leverage.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
