# EP-665 partial resolution

## Statement
Do there exist pairwise balanced designs with all block sizes
`> n^{1/2} - C` for some fixed constant `C` and all large `n`?

## What is resolved
Background gives:
- unconditional progress: `h(n) << n^{1/2-c}` (Erdos--Larson), with conditional
  improvement `h(n) << (log n)^2` under Cramer-type prime-gap assumptions;
- conditional negative result (Shrikhande--Singhi): under the projective-plane
  prime-power conjecture, the answer to the fixed-`C` question is no.

## What remains open in this note
An unconditional resolution of the fixed-constant question is not supplied by the
cited material.

## Status
- strong partial bounds and conditional "no": known.
- unconditional fixed-constant verdict: unresolved.
