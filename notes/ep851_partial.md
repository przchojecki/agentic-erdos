# EP-851 partial resolution

## Statement
For epsilon>0, ask whether some bounded r=r(epsilon) makes numbers of form 2^k+n
(with n having at most r prime factors) have density at least 1-epsilon.

## What is resolved
Background gives Romanoff baseline: for r=1 (prime n), the set 2^k+p has positive
lower density.

## What remains open in this note
Boosting from positive density to arbitrarily close to full density with bounded r
remains unresolved.

## Status
- positive-density base case known.
- near-full-density statement open.
