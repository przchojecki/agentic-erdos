# EP-810 deep attempt (open)

## Statement
Ask whether there exists epsilon>0 so that for all large n there is an n-vertex graph
with at least epsilon n^2 edges and an n-color edge-coloring in which every C4 has 4
distinct colors.

## Attempt route
Tried random-coloring and sparse-dependency heuristics under dense-edge conditions.

## Obstacle
C4 constraints are highly correlated in dense graphs, and this attempt did not yield a
construction with positive-density edges.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
