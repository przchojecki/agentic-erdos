# EP-486 partial resolution

## Statement
For forbidden residue sets X_n mod n over n in A, ask whether the uncovered set B
always has logarithmic density.

## What is resolved
Background gives positive result when each X_n={0} (Davenport-Erdos), with an
alternative elementary proof.

## What remains open in this note
The general case with arbitrary residue subsets X_n is unresolved.

## Status
- singleton-residue case solved.
- full multi-residue generalization open.
