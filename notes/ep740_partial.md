# EP-740 partial resolution

## Statement
For infinite cardinal `m`, if `chi(G)=m`, must `G` contain a subgraph of
chromatic number `m` with no odd cycle of length `<= r`?

## What is resolved
Background records a positive result by Rodl in the specific case
`m=aleph_0` and `r=3`.

So this concrete infinite-cardinal / odd-cycle-threshold case is solved.

## What remains open in this note
The full statement for arbitrary infinite `m` and arbitrary `r` remains open in
the cited material. Background also indicates even broader related formulations
are unresolved.

## Status
- `(m,r)=(aleph_0,3)`: resolved.
- general `(m,r)`: unresolved.
