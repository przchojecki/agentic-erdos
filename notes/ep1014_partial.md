# EP-1014 deep attempt (open)

## Statement
For fixed k>=3, prove R(k,l+1)/R(k,l)->1 as l->infinity.

## Attempt route
Tried ratio-stability heuristics from known off-diagonal Ramsey growth frameworks.

## Obstacle
Background states this is open even for k=3; current methods do not settle the
ratio-limit claim.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
