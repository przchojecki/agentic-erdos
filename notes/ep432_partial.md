# EP-432 deep attempt (no partial theorem extracted)

## Statement
Given infinite sets `A,B subset N`, how dense can `A+B` be under the condition
that elements of `A+B` are pairwise coprime?

## Attempt route
Tried additive-energy and smoothness-decomposition bounds under pairwise-coprime
constraints on sumset values.

## Obstacle
Background gives only attribution without explicit theorem-level bounds for this
exact formulation.

## Status
- no proof or counterexample obtained in this attempt.
