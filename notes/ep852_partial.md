# EP-852 partial resolution

## Statement
For consecutive prime gaps d_n, let h(x) be the longest run of pairwise-distinct
consecutive gaps among indices n<x. Estimate h(x).

## What is resolved
Background gives h(x)->infinity via Brun sieve.

## What remains open in this note
Quantitative growth (e.g. h(x)>(log x)^c) and upper control such as h(x)=o(log x)
remain unresolved here.

## Status
- qualitative divergence known.
- sharp growth-rate bounds unresolved.
