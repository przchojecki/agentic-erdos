# EP-975 partial resolution

## Statement
For irreducible nonconstant `f in Z[x]` (eventually positive), ask whether

`sum_{n<=X} tau(f(n)) ~ c(f) X log X`.

## What is resolved
Background provides:
- general two-sided order of magnitude:
  `sum_{n<=X} tau(f(n))` is between constants times `X log X`;
- full asymptotic is known when `f` is irreducible quadratic (Hooley);
- explicit constants are worked out in several quadratic families.

So the quadratic irreducible case is solved.

## What remains open in this note
The general irreducible case (higher degree in particular) is not resolved by the
provided background.

## Status
- Irreducible quadratic case: resolved.
- General irreducible case: unresolved here.
